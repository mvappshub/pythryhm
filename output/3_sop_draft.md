# SOP for IT Systems Management in Clinical Trials

## 1. Purpose
The objective of this procedure is to outline the GxP Computerized System Lifecycle Management process in alignment with the ICH E6(R3) guidelines. This SOP aims to ensure that IT systems used in clinical trials support Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles, enhance data quality, and comply with regulatory requirements.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all personnel involved with the implementation, management, and support of GxP computerized systems within clinical trials. It covers the lifecycle from system identification and vendor selection through to system retirement. This procedure does not apply to systems that were implemented prior to this SOP going into effect. In cases where a vendor performs validation on behalf of the organization, specific considerations outlined in this SOP must still be adhered to.

## 3. Glossary
(TBD - To include definitions of GxP, IT systems, ICH E6(R3), GCP, and other relevant terms.)

## 4. Responsibility
(TBD - To detail the responsibilities of IT Systems Specialists, Quality and Risk Managers, Regulatory Compliance Analysts, and other relevant personnel.)

## 5. Workflow
(TBD - To provide a visual and descriptive workflow of the GxP Computerized System Lifecycle Management process.)

## 6. Procedures

### 6.1 GXP System Identification and Vendor Selection
- Identify IT system needs based on clinical trial requirements.
- Select vendors that comply with ICH E6(R3) guidelines and have a proven track record in GCP-compliant systems.

### 6.2 GXP System Validation Representative
- Appoint a validation representative responsible for overseeing the system validation process and ensuring compliance with this SOP.

### 6.3 User Requirements Specification (URS)
- Document user requirements clearly, ensuring they align with clinical trial objectives and GCP principles.

### 6.4 Configuration Specification
- Define system configuration requirements to meet the URS and ensure data integrity and security.

### 6.5 IQ/OQ/PQ & User Acceptance Testing
- Conduct Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) followed by User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure the system meets all specified requirements.

### 6.6 Validation Summary Report
- Prepare a validation summary report documenting the validation process, outcomes, and any deviations or corrective actions taken.

### 6.7 GXP Computerized System Use, Maintenance, and Periodic Review
- Outline procedures for the regular use, maintenance, and periodic review of the IT system to ensure ongoing compliance and effectiveness.

### 6.8 GXP Computerized System Retirement
- Define the process for the retirement of IT systems, including data migration, archiving, and ensuring no data integrity is compromised during the process.

## 7. Related Work Instructions
(TBD - To include instructions on specific tasks or operations related to the IT systems management process.)

## 8. Related Template/Forms
(TBD - To list and provide access to related templates and forms used in the IT systems management process.)

## 9. References
- ICH E6(R3) Guidelines
- Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Principles
- Other relevant regulatory documents and guidelines

## 10. Version History
(TBD - To document the revision history of the SOP, including dates, changes made, and the author of the changes.)
