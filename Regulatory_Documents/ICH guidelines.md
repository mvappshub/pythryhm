ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
1 
I. INTRODUCTION  
1 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international, ethical, scientific and quality standard for the 
2 
conduct of trials that involve human participants. Clinical trials conducted in accordance with 
3 
this standard will help to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are 
4 
protected; that the conduct is consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
5 
Declaration of Helsinki; and that the clinical trial results are reliable. The term “trial conduct” 
6 
in this document includes processes from planning to reporting, including planning, initiating, 
7 
performing, recording, oversight, evaluation, analysis and reporting activities as appropriate. 
8 
The objective of this ICH GCP Guideline is to provide a unified standard to facilitate the mutual 
9 
acceptance of clinical trial data for ICH member countries and regions by applicable regulatory 
10 
authorities.  
11 
This guideline builds on key concepts outlined in ICH E8(R1) General Considerations for 
12 
Clinical Studies. This includes fostering a quality culture and proactively designing quality into 
13 
clinical trials and drug development planning, identifying factors critical to trial quality, and 
14 
engaging stakeholders, as appropriate, using a proportionate risk-based approach. 
15 
Clinical trials vary widely in scale, complexity and cost. Careful evaluation of the priorities 
16 
involved in each trial and the risks associated with the priorities will help ensure efficiency by 
17 
focusing on activities critical to achieving the trial objectives. 
18 
Guideline Scope 
 
19 
This guideline applies to interventional clinical trials of investigational products 1 that are 
20 
intended to be submitted to regulatory authorities. This guideline may also be applicable to 
21 
other interventional clinical trials of investigational products that are not intended to support 
22 
marketing authorisation applications in accordance with local requirements. 
23 
Guideline Structure 
24 
This ICH GCP Guideline is composed of principles and annexes that expand on the principles, 
25 
with specific details for different types of clinical trials. The principles are intended to apply 
26 
across clinical trial types and settings and to remain relevant as technological and 
27 
methodological advances occur. The principles outlined in this guideline may be satisfied using 
28 
differing approaches and should be applied to fit the intended purpose of the clinical trial. 
29 
Annex-1 is intended to provide information on how the principles can be appropriately applied 
30 
to clinical trials. Additional annexes may be developed to respond to stakeholder needs and to 
31 
address emerging innovations in trial design and conduct. This guideline should be read in 
32 
conjunction with other ICH guidelines relevant to the design and conduct of clinical trials, 
33 
including multiregional trials.  
34 
 
 
1 For the purpose of this guideline, the term “investigational products” should be considered synonymous with 
drugs, medicines, medicinal products, vaccines and biological products.

II. PRINCIPLES OF ICH GCP  
35 
Clinical trials are a fundamental part of clinical research that support the development of new 
36 
medicines or uses of existing medicines. Well-designed and conducted clinical trials help 
37 
answer key questions in healthcare and drug development. Their results are essential for 
38 
evidence-based healthcare decisions. Trials with inadequate design and/or poorly conducted 
39 
trials may place participant safety at risk and yield inadequate or unreliable evidence and are 
40 
unethical. They waste resources and the efforts and time of investigators and participants.  
41 
The principles of GCP are designed to be flexible and applicable to a broad range of clinical 
42 
trials. This guideline, along with ICH E8(R1), encourages thoughtful consideration and 
43 
planning to address specific and potentially unique aspects of an individual clinical trial. This 
44 
includes evaluation of trial characteristics, such as the design elements, the investigational 
45 
product being evaluated, the medical condition being addressed, the characteristics of the 
46 
participants, the setting in which the clinical trial is being conducted, and the type of data being 
47 
collected. Careful consideration of factors relevant to ensuring trial quality is needed for each 
48 
clinical trial.  
49 
The principles are intended to support efficient approaches to trial design and conduct. For 
50 
example, innovative digital health technologies, such as wearables and sensors, may expand 
51 
the possible approaches to trial conduct. Such technologies can be incorporated into existing 
52 
healthcare infrastructures and enable the use of a variety of relevant data sources in clinical 
53 
trials. This will aid in keeping clinical trial conduct in line with advancing science and 
54 
technological developments. The use of technology in the conduct of clinical trials should be 
55 
adapted to fit the participant characteristics and the particular trial design. This guideline is 
56 
intended to be media neutral to enable the use of different technologies for the purposes of 
57 
documentation. 
58 
The use of innovative clinical trial designs and technologies may help include diverse patient 
59 
populations, as appropriate, and enable wider participation. The design of the trial, to ensure 
60 
appropriate quality and meaningful trial outcomes, may be supported by the perspectives of 
61 
stakeholders; for example, patients and/or healthcare providers. Their input can increase the 
62 
likelihood of meaningful trial outcomes, which are relevant to both trial participants and future 
63 
patients. This input will also guide decisions on the feasibility of data collection and assure that 
64 
participation in the trial does not become unduly burdensome for those involved.  
65 
Clinical trials should be designed to protect the rights, safety and well-being of participants and 
66 
assure the reliability of results. Quality by design should be implemented to identify the factors 
67 
(i.e., data and processes) that are critical to ensuring trial quality and the risks that threaten the 
68 
integrity of those factors and ultimately the reliability of the trial results. Clinical trial processes 
69 
and risk mitigation strategies implemented to support the conduct of the trial should be 
70 
proportionate to the importance of the data being collected and the risks to trial participant 
71 
safety and data reliability. Trial designs should be operationally feasible and avoid unnecessary 
72 
complexities.  
73 
The overarching principles provide a flexible framework for clinical trial conduct. They are 
74 
structured to provide guidance throughout the life cycle of the clinical trial. These principles 
75 
are applicable to trials involving human participants. The principles are interdependent and 
76 
should be considered in their totality to assure ethical trial conduct and reliable results.

1. 
Clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that 
78 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with GCP 
79 
and applicable regulatory requirement(s). Clinical trials should be designed and 
80 
conducted in ways that ensure the rights, safety and well-being of participants.  
81 
 
82 
1.1 
The rights, safety and well-being of the participants are the most important 
83 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
84 
1.2 
The safety of the participants should be reviewed periodically as new safety 
85 
information becomes available, which could have an impact on the participant 
86 
or the conduct of the trial.  
87 
1.3 
Foreseeable risks and inconveniences should be weighed against the anticipated 
88 
benefits for the individual participants and society. A trial should be initiated 
89 
and continued only if the anticipated benefits justify the known and anticipated 
90 
risks.  
91 
1.4 
When designing a clinical trial, the scientific goal and purpose should be 
92 
carefully considered so as not to unnecessarily exclude particular participant 
93 
populations. The participant selection process should be representative of the 
94 
anticipated population who is likely to use the medicinal product in future 
95 
clinical practice to allow for generalising the results across the broader 
96 
population. Certain trials (e.g., early phase, proof of concept trials, 
97 
bioequivalence studies) may not require a heterogeneous population.  
98 
1.5 
A qualified physician or, when appropriate, a qualified dentist (or other 
99 
qualified healthcare professionals in accordance with local regulatory 
100 
requirements) should have the overall responsibility for the trial-related medical 
101 
care given to, and medical decisions made on behalf of, participants; however, 
102 
the practical interactions and the delivery of medical care and decisions can be 
103 
carried out by appropriately qualified healthcare professionals in accordance 
104 
with applicable regulatory requirements.  
105 
1.6 
The confidentiality of information that could identify participants should be 
106 
protected in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection 
107 
requirements.  
108 
 
109 
2. 
Informed consent is an integral feature of the ethical conduct of a trial. Clinical 
110 
trial participation should be voluntary and based on a consent process that 
111 
ensures participants (or their legally acceptable representatives, where 
112 
applicable) are well-informed.  
113 
 
114 
2.1 
Freely given informed consent should be obtained and documented from every 
115 
participant prior to clinical trial participation. For potential participants unable 
116 
to provide informed consent, their legally acceptable representative should 
117 
provide consent prior to clinical trial participation.  
118 
2.2 
The process and information provided should be designed to achieve the 
119 
primary objective of enabling potential trial participants to evaluate the benefits 
120 
and risks of participating in the trial and to make an informed decision on 
121 
whether or not to participate in the trial. The information provided during the 
122 


# Page 11

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
4 
 
informed consent process should be clear and concise so as to be understandable 
123 
by potential participants or legally acceptable representatives. 
124 
2.3 
The informed consent process should take into consideration relevant aspects 
125 
of the trial, such as the characteristics of the participants, the trial design, the 
126 
anticipated benefit and risk of medical intervention(s), the setting and context 
127 
in which the trial will be conducted (e.g., trials in emergency situations), and 
128 
the potential use of technology to inform participants (or their legally 
129 
acceptable representatives) and obtain informed consent.  
130 
 
131 
3. 
Clinical trials should be subject to an independent review by an institutional 
132 
review board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC).  
133 
 
134 
3.1 
A trial should always be conducted in compliance with the protocol that 
135 
receives prior IRB/IEC approval/favourable opinion.  
136 
3.2 
Periodic review of the trial by the IRB/IEC should also be conducted in 
137 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
138 
 
139 
4. 
Clinical trials should be scientifically sound for their intended purpose and based 
140 
on robust and current scientific knowledge and approaches.  
141 
 
142 
4.1 
The available nonclinical and clinical information on an investigational 
143 
product(s) should be adequate to support the proposed clinical trial.  
144 
4.2 
Clinical trials should be scientifically sound and reflect the state of knowledge 
145 
and experience with the investigational product(s), including, if applicable, the 
146 
condition to be treated, diagnosed or prevented; the current understanding of 
147 
the underlying biological mechanism (of both the condition and the treatment); 
148 
and the population for which the investigational product is intended.  
149 
4.3 
There should be periodic review of current scientific knowledge and approaches 
150 
to determine whether modifications to the trial are needed, since new or 
151 
unanticipated information may arise once the trial has begun.  
152 
 
153 
5. 
Clinical trials should be designed and conducted by qualified individuals.  
154 
 
155 
5.1 
Individuals with different expertise and training may be needed across all 
156 
phases of a clinical trial, such as physicians, scientists, ethicists, technology 
157 
experts, trial coordinators, monitors, auditors and statisticians. Individuals 
158 
involved in a trial should be qualified by education, training and experience to 
159 
perform their respective task(s).  
160 
 
161 
6. 
Quality should be built into the scientific and operational design and conduct of 
162 
clinical trials.  
163 
 
164 
6.1 
Quality of a clinical trial is considered in this guideline as fit for purpose. The 
165 
quality and amount of the information generated during a clinical trial should 
166 
support good decision making.  
167 


# Page 12

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
5 
 
6.2 
Factors critical to the quality of the trial should be identified. These factors are 
168 
attributes of a trial that are fundamental to the protection of participants, the 
169 
reliability and interpretability of the trial results and the decisions made based 
170 
on those trial results. Quality by design involves focusing on the design of all 
171 
components of the trial in order to maximise the likelihood of trial success (i.e., 
172 
that the trial will answer the research question). 
173 
6.3 
Strategies should be implemented to avoid, detect and address serious non-
174 
compliance with GCP, the trial protocol and applicable regulatory requirements 
175 
to prevent recurrence.  
176 
 
177 
7. 
Clinical trial processes, measures and approaches should be implemented in a 
178 
way that is proportionate to the risks to participants and to the importance of 
179 
the data collected.  
180 
 
181 
7.1 
Trial processes should be proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the 
182 
importance of the information collected. Risks in this context include risks to 
183 
the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants as well as risks to the 
184 
reliability of the trial results.  
185 
7.2 
The focus should be on the risks to participants beyond those associated with 
186 
standard medical care. The risks relating to investigational products that have a 
187 
marketing authorisation when used in the clinical trial context may differ from 
188 
the routine care of patients and should be taken into consideration.  
189 
7.3 
Risks to critical to quality factors should be managed prospectively and 
190 
adjusted when new or unanticipated issues arise once the trial has begun. 
191 
 
192 
8. 
Clinical trials should be described in a clear, concise and operationally feasible 
193 
protocol.  
194 
 
195 
8.1 
A well-designed trial protocol is fundamental to the protection of participants 
196 
and for the generation of reliable results.  
197 
8.2 
The scientific objectives of any trial should be clear and explicitly stated in the 
198 
protocol.  
199 
8.3 
The clinical trial protocol as well as the plans or documents for the protocol 
200 
execution (e.g., statistical analysis plan, data management plan, monitoring 
201 
plan) should be clear, concise and operationally feasible. 
202 
 
203 
9. 
Clinical trials should generate reliable results. 
204 
 
205 
9.1 
The quality and amount of the information generated in a clinical trial should 
206 
be sufficient to provide confidence in the trial’s results and support good 
207 
decision making.  
208 
9.2 
Systems and processes that aid in data capture, management and analyses, as 
209 
well as those that help ensure the quality of the information generated from the 
210 
trial, should be fit for purpose, should capture the data required by the protocol 
211 
and should be implemented in a way that is proportionate to the risks to 
212 
participants and the importance of acquired data.  
213 


# Page 13

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
6 
 
9.3 
Trial processes should be operationally feasible and avoid unnecessary 
214 
complexity, procedures and data collection. Trial processes should support the 
215 
key trial objectives.  
216 
9.4 
Computerised systems used in clinical trials should be fit for purpose, and 
217 
factors critical to their quality should be addressed in their design or adaptation 
218 
for clinical trial purposes.  
219 
9.5 
Clinical trials should incorporate efficient and well-controlled processes for 
220 
managing records through appropriate management of data integrity, 
221 
traceability and protection of personal information, thereby allowing the 
222 
accurate reporting, interpretation and verification of the clinical trial-related 
223 
information.  
224 
9.6 
Clinical trial-related records should be retained securely by sponsors and 
225 
investigators for the required period of time and should be available to 
226 
regulatory authorities upon request to enable reconstruction of the trial conduct 
227 
and results in order to ensure the reliability of trial results.  
228 
9.7 
The transparency of clinical trials in drug development includes registration on 
229 
publicly accessible and recognised databases and the public posting of clinical 
230 
trial results.  
231 
 
232 
10. 
Roles and responsibilities in clinical trials should be clear and documented 
233 
appropriately.  
234 
 
235 
10.1 The sponsor may transfer or the investigator may delegate some or all their 
236 
tasks, duties or functions (hereafter referred to as activities), but they retain 
237 
overall responsibility for their respective activities.  
238 
10.2 Agreements should clearly define the roles, activities and responsibilities for 
239 
the clinical trial and be documented appropriately. Where activities have been 
240 
transferred or delegated to service providers, the responsibility for the conduct 
241 
of the trial, including quality and integrity of the trial data, resides with the 
242 
sponsor or investigator, respectively.  
243 
10.3 The sponsor or investigator should maintain appropriate oversight or 
244 
supervision of the aforementioned activities, respectively.  
245 
 
246 
11. 
Investigational products used in a clinical trial should be manufactured in 
247 
accordance with applicable Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and 
248 
be stored, shipped, handled and disposed of in accordance with the product 
249 
specifications and the trial protocol.  
250 
  
251 
11.1 Investigational products used in a clinical trial should be manufactured in 
252 
accordance with applicable GMP standards. 
253 
11.2 Measures should be in place to ensure that the investigational product provided 
254 
to trial participants retains its quality. 
255 
11.3 Investigational products should be used in accordance with the protocol and 
256 
relevant trial documents.  
257 


# Page 14

11.4 Manufacturing, handling and labelling of investigational products should be 
258 
undertaken in a manner that aligns with treatment assignment and maintains 
259 
blinding, where applicable. 
260 
11.5 Investigational product labelling should follow applicable regulatory 
261 
requirements.  
262 
11.6 Adequate measures to ensure that the investigational product is handled and 
263 
shipped appropriately should be implemented.

III. ANNEX 1  
266 
1. 
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE 
267 
(IRB/IEC)  
268 
The IRB/IEC is responsible for the ethical review of the trial. The requirements for 
269 
the IRB/IEC in this guideline should be read in conjunction with local regulatory 
270 
requirements. 
271 
1.1 
Responsibilities 
272 
1.1.1 
The purpose of an IRB/IEC is to safeguard the rights, safety and well-being of all trial 
273 
participants.  
274 
 
275 
1.1.2 
The IRB/IEC should review the following information, where applicable: 
276 
 
277 
(a) 
protocol and any amendments; 
278 
 
279 
(b) 
informed consent material(s), assent form(s), where applicable, and any 
280 
updates, including the description of the process for how informed consent is 
281 
to be obtained; 
282 
 
283 
(c) 
Investigator’s Brochure or current scientific information, such as a basic 
284 
product information brochure (e.g., Summary of Product Characteristics 
285 
(SmPC), package leaflet or labelling), as appropriate, including their updates; 
286 
 
287 
(d) 
any other information to be provided to the trial participant(s), including a 
288 
description of the media through which such information will be provided; 
289 
 
290 
(e) 
advertisement for participant recruitment (if used) and information on the 
291 
recruitment process;  
292 
 
293 
(f) 
plans to compensate participants (if any); 
294 
 
295 
(g) 
ongoing updates to safety information (dependent on requirements of the 
296 
IRB/IEC); 
297 
 
298 
(h) 
investigator’s current curriculum vitae and/or other documentation evidencing 
299 
qualifications; 
300 
 
301 


# Page 15

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
8 
 
(i) 
any other documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfil its responsibilities. 
302 
 
303 
1.1.3 
The IRB/IEC should review a proposed clinical trial within a reasonable time and 
304 
document its reviews clearly identifying the trial, the documents reviewed and the 
305 
dates for the following: 
306 
 
307 
(a) 
approval/favourable opinion; 
308 
 
309 
(b) 
modifications required prior to its approval/favourable opinion; 
310 
 
311 
(c) 
disapproval/negative opinion; 
312 
 
313 
(d) 
termination/suspension of any prior approval/favourable opinion. 
314 
 
315 
1.1.4 
The IRB/IEC should conduct continuing review of each ongoing trial at intervals 
316 
appropriate to the degree of risk to participants. 
317 
 
318 
1.1.5 
The IRB/IEC may request more information than is outlined in section 2.8.11 be given 
319 
to participants when, in the judgement of the IRB/IEC, the additional information 
320 
would add meaningfully to the protection of the rights, safety and/or well-being of the 
321 
participants.  
322 
 
323 
1.1.6 
Where the protocol indicates that prior consent of the trial participant or the 
324 
participant’s legally acceptable representative is not possible (see section 2.8.9), the 
325 
IRB/IEC should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) 
326 
adequately address relevant ethical concerns and meet applicable regulatory 
327 
requirements for such trials (e.g., in emergency situations). 
328 
 
329 
1.1.7 
If minors are to be included in a trial, the IRB/IEC should review the assent 
330 
information considering the age, maturity and psychological state of the minor, as 
331 
well as applicable regulatory requirements. 
332 
 
333 
1.1.8 
If the trial participants are compensated for their participation in the trial, the IRB/IEC 
334 
should review both the amount and method of payment to participants to assure that 
335 
neither presents problems of coercion or undue influence on the trial participants. 
336 
Payments to a participant should be prorated and not wholly contingent on completion 
337 
of the trial by the participant. Reasonable reimbursement of participants for travel and 
338 
lodging is not typically coercive.  
339 
 
340 
1.1.9 
The IRB/IEC should ensure that information regarding payment to participants, 
341 
including the methods, amounts and schedule of payment to trial participants, is set 
342 
forth in the informed consent material and any other information to be provided to 
343 
participants.

1.2 
Composition, Functions and Operations 
345 
1.2.1 
The IRB/IEC should consist of a reasonable number of members who collectively 
346 
have the qualifications and experience to review and evaluate the science, medical 
347 
aspects and ethics of the proposed trial. It is recommended that the IRB/IEC should 
348 
include: 
349 
 
350 
(a) 
at least five members; 
351 
 
352 
(b) 
at least one member whose primary area of interest is not in medical sciences; 
353 
 
354 
(c) 
at least one member who is independent of the institution/investigator site. 
355 
 
356 
Only those IRB/IEC members who are independent of the investigator and the sponsor 
357 
of the trial should vote/provide an opinion. A list of IRB/IEC members and their 
358 
qualifications should be maintained. 
359 
 
360 
1.2.2 
The IRB/IEC should perform its functions according to documented operating 
361 
procedures, should maintain records of its activities and minutes of its meetings, and 
362 
should comply with GCP and with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
363 
 
364 
1.2.3 
An IRB/IEC should make its decisions at announced meetings at which at least a 
365 
quorum, as stipulated in its documented operating procedures, is present. 
366 
 
367 
1.2.4 
Only members who participate in the IRB/IEC review and discussion should

472 
 
473 
2.3.3 
The investigator should ensure a record is maintained of the persons and parties to 
474 
whom the investigator has delegated significant trial-related activities. In situations 
475 
where the clinical trial activities are performed in accordance with routine clinical 
476 
care, delegation documentation may not be required. 
477 
 
478

479 
related activities should be documented. 
480 
 
481 
2.3.5 
The investigator/institution should permit monitoring and auditing by the sponsor and 
482 
inspection by the appropriate regulatory authority(ies).  
483 
2.4 
Communication with IRB/IEC  
484 
2.4.1 
Submission to the IRB/IEC may be made by the investigator/institution or sponsor in 
485 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements (see section 1.5). 
486

491 
 
492 
2.4.3 
As part of the investigator’s/institution’s or sponsor’s (in accordance with applicable 
493 
regulatory requirements) submission to the IRB/IEC, a current copy of the 
494 
Investigator’s Brochure or basic product information brochure should be provided 
495 
(see section A.1.1 of Appendix A. Investigator’s Brochure). If the Investigator’s 
496 
Brochure is updated during the trial, the IRB/IEC should receive the current version 
497 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
498 
 
499 
2.4.4 
As the trial progresses, the investigator/institution or sponsor should provide any 
500 
updates to the participant information according to applicable regulatory

514 


# Page 20

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
13 
 
2.5.2 
The investigator should document all protocol deviations and review deviations 
515 
communicated to them by the sponsor. For important deviations, the investigator 
516 
should explain the deviation and implement appropriate measures to prevent a 
517 
recurrence, where applicable, see section 3.9.3.  
518 
 
519 
2.5.3 
The investigator should follow the protocol and deviate only where necessary to 
520 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial participants. In case of deviations undertaken 
521 
to eliminate immediate hazard to trial participants, the investigator should inform the 
522 
sponsor, IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authorities promptly. 
523 
 
524 
2.5.4 
The investigator should report information on the immediate hazard, the implemented 
525 
change and the subsequent proposed protocol amendment to the IRB/IEC and/or 
526 
regulatory authorities.  
527 
2.6 
Premature Termination or Suspension of a Trial  
528 
2.6.1 
If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the 
529 
investigator/institution should promptly inform the trial participants and should assure 
530 
appropriate therapy and follow-up for the participants. 
531 
  
532 
2.6.2 
Where the investigator terminates or suspends their involvement in a trial without 
533 
prior agreement by the sponsor, the investigator should promptly inform the sponsor, 
534 
the IRB/IEC and the regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable regulatory 
535 
requirements and should provide a detailed explanation of the reasons. 
536 
 
537 
2.6.3 
If the sponsor terminates or suspends a trial, the investigator/institution, or the 
538 
sponsor, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s), should promptly 
539 
inform the IRB/IEC and the regulatory authorities. See section 3.17.1. 
540 
 
541 
2.6.4 
If the IRB/IEC terminates or suspends its approval/favourable opinion of a trial (see 
542 
sections 1.1.3 and 1.3.9), the investigator should inform the institution, where 
543 
applicable, and the investigator/institution should promptly notify the sponsor.  
544 
2.7 
Participant Medical Care and Safety Reporting 
545 
2.7.1 
Medical Care of Trial Participants  
546 
(a) 
A qualified physician or, where appropriate, a qualified dentist (or other 
547 
qualified healthcare professionals in accordance with local regulatory 
548 
requirements) who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial should 
549 
have the overall responsibility for trial-related medical care and decisions.  
550 
 
551 
(b) 
Other appropriately qualified healthcare professionals may be involved in the 
552 
medical care of trial participants, in line with their normal activities and in 
553 
accordance with local regulatory requirements. 
554 
 
555 
(c) 
During and following participation in a trial, the investigator/institution should 
556 
ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a participant for any adverse 
557 
events, including clinically significant laboratory values, related to the trial. 
558 


# Page 21

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
14 
 
The investigator/institution should inform a participant when medical care is 
559 
needed for intercurrent illness(es) of which the investigator becomes aware.  
560 
 
561 
(d) 
The investigator should inform the participant’s primary physician about the 
562 
participant’s involvement in the trial if the participant has a primary physician 
563 
and agrees to the primary physician being informed.  
564 
2.7.2 
Safety Reporting  
565 
(a) 
Adverse events and/or laboratory abnormalities required for safety evaluations 
566 
(as outlined in the protocol) should be reported to the sponsor according to the 
567 
reporting requirements and within the time periods specified in the protocol.  
568 
 
569 
(b) 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported immediately (after the 
570 
investigator reasonably becomes aware of the event) to the sponsor. In 
571 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the protocol may identify 
572 
SAEs not requiring immediate reporting, for example, deaths or other events 
573 
that are endpoints. Subsequent information should be submitted as a follow-
574 
up report, as necessary.        
575 
 
576 
(c) 
For reported deaths, the investigator should supply the sponsor, the IRB/IEC 
577 
and, where applicable, the regulatory authority with any additional requested 
578 
information (e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports) when they 
579 
become available.  
580 
 
581 
(d) 
The investigator may delegate activities for safety reporting to qualified 
582 
investigator site staff but retains the overall responsibility for safety of 
583 
participants under their responsibility and compliance with the reporting 
584 
requirements.  
585 
2.8 
Informed Consent of Trial Participants  
586 
2.8.1 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent (paper or electronic format), the 
587 
investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should 
588 
adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
589 
Helsinki. See the glossary term “informed consent.” The informed consent process 
590 
should include the following: 
591 
  
592 
(a) 
Prior to consenting and enrolling participants, the investigator should have the 
593 
IRB/IEC’s documented approval/favourable opinion of the informed consent 
594 
materials and process;  
595 
 
596 
(b) 
The information should be as clear and concise as possible, use simple 
597 
language and avoid unnecessary volume and complexity. This is to ensure that 
598 
the trial participants or their legally acceptable representatives have an 
599 
adequate understanding of the objectives of the trial, alternative treatments, 
600 
the potential benefits and risks, burdens and their rights and obligations to be 
601 
able to make an informed decision as to their participation in the trial; 
602 


# Page 22

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
15 
 
(c) 
Varied approaches (e.g., text, images, videos and other interactive methods) 
603 
may be used in the informed consent process including for providing 
604 
information to the participant. Obtaining consent remotely may be considered 
605 
where appropriate.  
606 
 
607 
2.8.2 
The participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should be 
608 
informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be 
609 
relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue trial participation. The 
610 
communication of this information and confirmation of the willingness to continue 
611 
trial participation should be documented.  
612 
 
613 
New information that could impact a participant’s willingness to continue 
614 
participation should be assessed to determine if re-consent is needed (e.g., depending 
615 
on the stage of the trial, consideration should be given to whether the new information 
616 
is relevant only to new participants or to existing participants). If re-consent is needed 
617 
(e.g., information on emerging safety concerns), new information should be clearly 
618 
identified in the revised informed consent materials. Revised informed consent 
619 
materials should receive the IRB/IEC’s approval/favourable opinion in advance of 
620 
use.  
621 
 
622 
2.8.3 
Neither the investigator nor the investigator site staff should coerce or unduly 
623 
influence a participant to participate or to continue their participation in the trial.  
624 
 
625 
2.8.4 
None of the information provided to the participant during the informed consent 
626 
process should contain any language that causes the participant or the participant’s 
627 
legally acceptable representative to waive or to appear to waive any legal rights, or 
628 
that releases or appears to release the investigator, the institution, the sponsor or their 
629 
service providers from liability for negligence.  
630 
 
631 
2.8.5 
The informed consent process should be conducted by the investigator or other 
632 
investigator site staff delegated by the investigator, in accordance with applicable 
633 
regulatory requirements. If the participant is unable to provide consent themselves, 
634 
the participant’s legally acceptable representative should provide their consent on 
635 
behalf of the participant.  
636 
 
637 
2.8.6 
The information provided during the informed consent process and translations should 
638 
be relevant, clear, simple, concise and understandable to the participant or the 
639 
participant’s legally acceptable representative and the impartial witness, where 
640 
applicable.  
641 
 
642 
2.8.7 
Before informed consent may be obtained, the investigator or investigator site staff 
643 
delegated by the investigator, in accordance with the protocol and conditions of 
644 
IRB/IEC favourable opinions/approvals, should provide the participant or the 
645 
participant’s legally acceptable representative ample time unless justified (e.g., in an 
646 
emergency situation) and opportunity to enquire about trial details and to decide 
647 
whether or not to participate in the trial. Questions about the trial should be answered 
648 


# Page 23

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
16 
 
to the satisfaction of the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable 
649 
representative. 
650 
 
651 
2.8.8 
Prior to trial participation, the informed consent form should be signed and dated by 
652 
the participant or by the participant’s legally acceptable representative and, where 
653 
appropriate, impartial witness and by the investigator or delegated investigator site 
654 
staff who conducted the informed consent discussion. The informed consent process 
655 
may involve a physical signature or an electronic signature. 
656 
  
657 
2.8.9 
In emergency situations, when prior consent of the participant is not possible, the 
658 
consent of the participant’s legally acceptable representative, if present, should be 
659 
requested. When prior consent of the participant is not possible and the participant’s 
660 
legally acceptable representative is not available, enrolment of the participant should 
661 
require measures described in the protocol and/or elsewhere, with documented 
662 
approval/favourable opinion by the IRB/IEC, to protect the participant’s rights, safety 
663 
and well-being and to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
664 
The participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should be 
665 
informed about the trial as soon as possible, and consent as appropriate (see section 
666 
2.8.10) should be requested. 
667 
 
668 
2.8.10 
If a participant or the legally acceptable representative is unable to read, an impartial 
669 
witness should be present (remotely or in-person) during the entire informed consent 
670 
discussion. After the informed consent form and any other information is read and 
671 
explained to the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative and 
672 
they have orally consented to the participant’s trial participation and, if capable of 
673 
doing so, have signed and personally dated the informed consent form, the witness 
674 
should contemporaneously sign and personally date the consent form. By signing the 
675 
consent form, the witness attests that the consent information was accurately 
676 
explained to and apparently understood by the participant or the participant’s legally 
677 
acceptable representative and that informed consent was freely given by the 
678 
participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative.  
679 
 
680 
2.8.11 
The informed consent discussion and the informed consent materials to be provided 
681 
to participants should explain the following as applicable:  
682 
 
683 
(a) 
the purpose of the trial;  
684 
 
685 
(b) 
that the trial involves research and summary of the experimental aspects of the 
686 
trial; 
687 
 
688 
(c) 
the trial’s investigational product(s) and the probability for random 
689 
assignment to the investigational product, if applicable;  
690 
 
691 
(d) 
the trial procedures to be followed including all invasive procedures;  
692 
 
693 
(e) 
the participant’s obligations; 
694 


# Page 24

17 
 
(f) 
the reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences to the participant and, when 
695 
applicable, the participant’s partner, to an embryo, foetus or nursing infant;  
696 
 
697 
(g) 
the reasonably expected benefits. When there is no intended clinical benefit to 
698 
the participant, the participant should be made aware of this;  
699 
 
700 
(h) 
the alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment that may be available to 
701 
the participant and their important potential benefits and risks;  
702 
 
703 
(i) 
the compensation and/or treatment available to the participant in the event of 
704 
trial-related injury;  
705 
 
706 
(j) 
any anticipated prorated compensation to the participant for trial participation;  
707 
 
708 
(k) 
any anticipated expenses to the participant for trial participation;  
709 
 
710 
(l) 
that the participant’s trial participation is voluntary, and the participant may 
711 
refuse to participate or may withdraw, at any time, without penalty or loss of 
712 
benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled; 
713 
 
714 
(m) 
the process by which the participant’s data will be handled, including in the 
715 
event of the withdrawal of participation in accordance with regulatory 
716 
requirements; 
717 
 
718 
(n) 
that by agreeing to participate in the trial, the participant or their legally 
719 
acceptable representative allows direct access to original medical records, per 
720 
applicable regulatory requirements, while safeguarding the confidentiality of 
721 
the participant. This access is limited for the purpose of reviewing trial 
722 
activities and/or reviewing or verifying data and records by the IRB/IEC(s), 
723 
regulatory authority(ies) and the sponsor’s representatives, for example, 
724 
monitor(s) or auditor(s); 
725 
 
726 
(o) 
that records identifying the participant will be kept confidential and, to the 
727 
extent permitted by the applicable regulatory requirements, will not be made 
728 
publicly available. If the trial results are published, the participant’s identity 
729 
will remain confidential. The trial may be registered on publicly accessible 
730 
and recognised databases, per applicable regulatory requirements; 
731 
 
732 
(p) 
that the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative will 
733 
be informed in a timely manner if information becomes available that may be 
734 
relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue trial participation;  
735

(r) 
the foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the participant’s 
740 
trial participation may be terminated;  
741 
 
742 
(s) 
the expected duration of the participant’s trial participation;  
743 
 
744 
(t) 
the approximate number of participants involved in the trial;  
745 
 
746 
(u) 
that trial results and information on the participant’s actual treatment, if 
747 
appropriate, will be made available to them should they desire it. 
748 
 
749 
2.8.12 
Prior to participation, the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable 
750 
representative should receive a copy (paper or electronic) of the signed informed 
751 
consent form and any other informed consent materials provided to the participants, 
752 
or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. During trial participation, 
753 
the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should receive a 
754 
copy of the consent form updates and any other updated informed consent materials 
755 
provided to participants. 
756 
 
757 
2.8.13 
Where a minor is to be included as a participant, age-appropriate assent information 
758 
should be provided and discussed with the minor as part of the consent process, and 
759 
assent from the minor to enrol in the trial should be obtained as appropriate. A process 
760 
for re-consent should be considered if, during the course of the trial, the minor reaches 
761 
the age of legal consent, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
762 
 
763 
2.8.14 
When a clinical trial includes participants who may only be enrolled in the trial with 
764 
the consent of the participant’s legally acceptable representative (e.g., minors, patients 
765 
with severe impaired decision-making capacity), the participant should be informed 
766 
about the trial to the extent compatible with the participant’s understanding and, if 
767 
capable, the participant should sign and personally date the informed consent form or 
768 
assent form as appropriate. 
769 
 
770 
2.8.15 
In exceptional circumstances (e.g., public health emergencies), when the usual 
771 
methods to obtain and document informed consent are not possible, the use of 
772 
alternative measures and technologies in accordance with local IRBs/IECs and 
773 
applicable regulatory requirements should be considered. 
774 
2.9 
End of Participation in a Clinical Trial 
775 
2.9.1 
When a participant decides to stop treatment with the investigational product, stop 
776 
trial visits or completely withdraw from a trial; is discontinued from the trial; or 
777 
reaches routine end of trial, the investigator should follow the protocol and other 
778 
sponsor instructions to determine appropriate follow-up measures. This may include 
779 
instructions to avoid unnecessary loss of already collected critical data in accordance 
780 
with applicable regulatory requirements. 
781 
 
782 
2.9.2 
Although a participant is not obliged to provide a reason(s) for withdrawing 
783 
prematurely from a trial, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain 
784 


# Page 26

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
19 
 
the reason(s), while fully respecting the participant’s rights. The investigator should 
785 
consider discussing with the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable 
786 
representative the reasons for withdrawal to determine if there are ways to address the 
787 
concerns. The investigator site staff should make an effort to explain to the participant 
788 
the value and importance of continuing their participation to minimise trial 
789 
participants withdrawal. 
790 
 
791 
2.9.3 
Where relevant, the investigator should inform the participant about the trial results 
792 
and treatment received when this information is available from the sponsor after 
793 
unblinding, with due respect to the participant’s preference to be informed.  
794 
2.10 
Investigational Product Management 
795 
2.10.1 
Responsibility for investigational product(s) accountability rests with the 
796 
investigator/institution. The sponsor may facilitate this process. 
797 
 
798 
2.10.2 
When the investigator/institution assigns some or all of their activities for 
799 
investigational product(s) accountability to a pharmacist or another individual, they 
800 
should be under the supervision of the investigator/institution. 
801 
 
802 
2.10.3 
The investigator/institution and/or a pharmacist or other appropriate individual should 
803 
maintain records of the product’s delivery, the inventory, the use by each participant 
804 
(including documenting that the participants were provided the doses specified by the 
805 
protocol) and the return to the sponsor and destruction or alternative disposition of 
806 
unused product(s). These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
807 
numbers, expiration dates (if applicable) and the unique code numbers assigned to the 
808 
investigational product(s) and trial participants. For authorised medicinal products, 
809 
alternative approaches to the aforementioned may be considered, in accordance with 
810 
local regulatory requirements.  
811 
 
812 
2.10.4 
The investigational product(s) should be stored as specified by the sponsor and in 
813 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
814 
 
815 
2.10.5 
The investigator should ensure that the investigational product(s) are used only in 
816 
accordance with the approved protocol.  
817 
 
818 
2.10.6 
Where 
applicable, 
the 
investigator 
or 
a 
person 
designated 
by 
the 
819 
investigator/institution should explain the correct use of the investigational product(s) 
820 
to each participant and should check, at intervals appropriate for the trial, that each 
821 
participant is following the instructions properly.  
822 
2.11 
Randomisation Procedures and Unblinding  
823 
The investigator should follow the trial’s randomisation procedures, if any, and, in the case of 
824 
an investigator-blinded trial, should ensure that the identification code is broken only in 
825 
accordance with the protocol. In the case of an emergency, to protect patient safety, the 
826 
investigator should be prepared and capable from the start of the trial to perform unblinding 
827 
without undue delay and hinderance. The investigator should promptly document and explain 
828 


# Page 27

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
20 
 
to the sponsor any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, emergency unblinding to 
829 
protect trial participant, unblinding due to an SAE) of the investigational product(s). 
830 
2.12 
Records  
831 
2.12.1 
In generating, recording and reporting trial data, the investigator should ensure the 
832 
integrity of data under their responsibility, irrespective of the media used. 
833 
 
834 
2.12.2 
The investigator/institution should maintain adequate source records that include 
835 
pertinent observations on each of the trial participants under their responsibility. 
836 
Source records should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate 
837 
and complete. Changes to source records should be traceable, should not obscure the 
838 
original entry and should be explained if necessary (via an audit trail). The 
839 
investigator should define what is considered to be a source record(s), the methods of 
840 
data capture and their location prior to starting the trial and should update this 
841 
definition when needed. Unnecessary transcription steps in between the source record 
842 
and the data acquisition tool should be avoided.  
843 
 
844 
2.12.3 
The investigator should have timely access to and be responsible for the timely review 
845 
of data, including relevant data from external sources (e.g., central laboratory data, 
846 
centrally read imaging data, other institution’s records and, if appropriate, electronic 
847 
patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data) which can have an impact on, for example, 
848 
participant eligibility, treatment or safety. The protocol may provide exceptions for 
849 
access, for instance, to protect blinding. 
850 
 
851 
2.12.4 
The investigator should ensure that data acquisition tools and other systems deployed 
852 
by the sponsor for clinical trial purposes are used as specified in the protocol or trial-
853 
related instructions. 
854 
 
855 
2.12.5 
The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility and timeliness 
856 
of the data reported to the sponsor in the data acquisition tools completed by the 
857 
investigator site (e.g., case report form (CRF)) and in all required reports. The 
858 
investigator should review and endorse the reported data at milestones agreed upon 
859 
with the sponsor (e.g., interim analysis).  
860 
 
861 
2.12.6 
Data reported to the sponsor should be consistent with the source records or the 
862 
discrepancies explained. Changes or corrections in the reported data should be 
863 
traceable, should be explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
864 
 
865 
2.12.7 
The investigator/institution should implement appropriate measures to protect the 
866 
privacy and confidentiality of personal information of trial participants in accordance 
867 
with applicable regulatory requirements on personal data protection. Data reported to 
868 
the sponsor should be identified by an unambiguous participant code that can be traced 
869 
back to the identity of the participant by the investigator/institution. 
870 
 
871 
2.12.8 
For systems deployed by the investigator/institution that maintain and retain trial 
872 
data/information, the investigator/institution should ensure that such data are 
873 


# Page 28

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
21 
 
protected from unauthorised access, disclosure, dissemination or alteration and from 
874 
inappropriate destruction or accidental loss.  
875 
 
876 
2.12.9 
When using computerised systems in a clinical trial, the investigator/institution should 
877 
do the following: 
878 
 
879 
(a) 
for systems deployed by the investigator/institution, ensure that appropriate 
880 
individuals have secure and attributable access; 
881 
 
882 
(b) 
for systems deployed by the investigator/institution specifically for the 
883 
purposes of clinical trials, ensure that the requirements for computerised 
884 
systems in section 4 are addressed; 
885 
 
886 
(c) 
where equipment for data acquisition is provided to trial participants by the 
887 
investigator, ensure that traceability is maintained and participants are 
888 
provided with appropriate training;  
889 
 
890 
(d) 
ensure that incidents in the use and operation of computerised systems, which 
891 
in their judgement may have a significant and/or persistent impact on the trial 
892 
data, are reported to the sponsor and, where applicable, to the IRB/IEC.  
893 
 
894 
2.12.10 The investigator/institution should maintain the trial records as specified in Appendix 
895 
C. Essential Records for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as required by the 
896 
applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution should have control 
897 
of all essential records generated by the investigator/institution before, during and 
898 
after the trial. The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental 
899 
or premature destruction of these records. If the investigator closes a site or leaves a 
900 
site during or after the end of the clinical trial, the sponsor should be notified of the 
901 
appropriate individual responsible for retention of the site’s essential records. 
902 
 
903 
2.12.11 The investigator/institution should retain the essential records for the required 
904 
retention period in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or until the 
905 
sponsor informs the investigator/institution that these records are no longer needed, 
906 
whichever is the longer (see Appendix C).  
907 
 
908 
2.12.12 Upon request of the monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC or regulatory authority, the 
909 
investigator/institution should make available for direct access all requested trial-
910 
related records.  
911 
2.13 
Clinical Trial/Study Reports 
912 
2.13.1 
Upon completion of the trial, the investigator, where applicable, should inform the 
913 
institution. The investigator/institution should provide the IRB/IEC with a summary 
914 
of the trial’s outcome and, if applicable, the regulatory authority(ies) with any 
915 
required reports.

3.1.1 
When planning trials, the sponsor should ensure that sufficient safety and efficacy 
927 
data from nonclinical studies and/or clinical trials and/or real-world data are available 
928 
to support human exposure by the route, at the dosages, for the duration and in the 
929 
trial population to be studied. 
930 
 
931 
3.1.2 
Sponsors should incorporate quality into the design of the clinical trial by identifying 
932 
factors that are critical to the quality of the trial and by managing risks to those factors.  
933 
 
934 
3.1.3 
Sponsors should consider inputs from a wide variety of stakeholders, for example, 
935 
healthcare professionals and patients, to support the development plan and clinical 
936 
trial protocols as described in ICH E8(R1) and when developing the informed consent 
937 
material and any other participant-facing information. 
938 
 
939 
3.1.4 
The sponsor should ensure that all aspects of the trial are operationally feasible and 
940 
should avoid unnecessary complexity, procedures and data collection. Protocols, data 
941 
acquisition tools and other operational documents should be fit for purpose, clear, 
942 
concise and consistent, when applicable.  
943 
3.2 
Resources 
944 
The sponsor should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately conduct the 
945 
trial. 
946 
3.3 
Allocation of Activities

948 
trial-related activities accordingly.  
949 
3.4 
Qualification and Training  
950 
The sponsor should utilise appropriately qualified individuals for the activities to which they 
951 
are assigned (e.g., biostatisticians, clinical pharmacologists, physicians, data scientists/data 
952 
managers, auditors and monitors) throughout the trial process. 
953 
3.4.1 
Medical Expertise 
954 
The sponsor should have medical personnel readily available who will be able to 
955 
advise on specific trial-related medical questions or problems.  
956

3.5 
Financing  
957 
The financial aspects of the trial should be documented in an agreement between the sponsor 
958 
and the investigator/institution.  
959 
3.6 
Agreements 
960 
3.6.1 
Agreements made by the sponsor with the investigator/institution, service providers 
961 
and any other parties (e.g., independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), 
962 
adjudication committee) involved with the clinical trial should be documented prior 
963 
to initiating the activities.  
964 
 
965 
3.6.2 
Agreements should be updated when necessary to reflect significant changes in the 
966 
activities delegated. 
967 
 
968 
3.6.3 
The sponsor should obtain the investigator’s/institution’s and, where applicable, 
969 
service provider’s agreement:  
970 
 
971 
(a) 
to conduct the trial in accordance with the approved protocol and in 
972 
compliance with GCP and applicable regulatory requirement(s);

(b) 
to comply with procedures for data recording/reporting;  
975 
 
976 
(c) 
to retain the trial-related essential records for the required retention period in 
977 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or until the sponsor 
978 
informs the investigator/institution or, where applicable, the service provider, 
979 
that these documents are no longer needed, whichever is longer; 
980 
 
981 
(d) 
to permit monitoring, auditing and inspections by sponsors, IRB/IECs and 
982 
regulatory authorities (domestic and foreign) including providing direct access 
983 
to source records and facilities, including to those of service providers.  
984 
 
985 
3.6.4 
The responsibilities of coordinating investigator(s) and the other participating 
986 
investigators should be documented prior to the start of the trial.  
987 
 
988 
3.6.5 
Any of the sponsor’s trial-related activities that are transferred to and assumed by a 
989 
service provider should be documented in an agreement. The sponsor’s trial-related 
990 
activities that are not specifically transferred to and assumed by a service provider are 
991 
retained by the sponsor.  
992 
 
993 
3.6.6 
The sponsor should provide information to the investigator on any service provider 
994 
identified by the sponsor to undertake any activities under the responsibility of the 
995 
investigator. The responsibility for such activities remains with the investigator. 
996 
 
997 
3.6.7 
A sponsor may transfer any or all of the sponsor’s trial-related activities to a service 
998 
provider; however, the ultimate responsibility for the sponsor’s trial-related activities, 
999 
including protection of participants’ rights, safety and well-being and reliability of the 
1000 
trial data, resides with the sponsor. Any service provider used for clinical trial 
1001

24 
 
activities should implement appropriate quality management and report to the sponsor 
1002 
any incidents that might have an impact on the safety of trial participants or/and trial 
1003 
results.  
1004 
 
1005 
3.6.8 
The sponsor is responsible for assessing the suitability of and selecting the service 
1006 
provider to ensure that they can adequately undertake the activities transferred to 
1007 
them. The sponsor should provide the service providers with the protocol where 
1008 
necessary as well as any other documents required for them to perform their activities.  
1009 
 
1010 
3.6.9 
The sponsor should have access to relevant information (e.g., SOPs and performance 
1011 
metrics) for selection and oversight of service providers. 
1012 
 
1013 
3.6.10 
The sponsor should ensure appropriate oversight of important trial-related activities 
1014 
that are transferred to service providers and further subcontracted.  
1015 
 
1016 
3.6.11 
Trial-related activities performed by service providers should be conducted in 
1017 
accordance with relevant GCP requirements, which may be fulfilled by a service 
1018 
provider’s existing processes.  
1019 
 
1020 
3.6.12 
A clinical trial may have one or several sponsors where permitted under applicable 
1021 
regulatory requirements. In trials with more than one sponsor, the sponsors should 
1022 
have a documented agreement that sets out their respective responsibilities, in 
1023 
accordance with local regulatory requirements and/or practice. Where the documented 
1024 
agreement does not specify to which sponsor a given responsibility is attributed, that 
1025 
responsibility lies with all sponsors. 
1026 
3.7 
Investigator Selection  
1027 
3.7.1 
The sponsor is responsible for selecting the investigator(s)/institution(s). Each 
1028 
investigator should be qualified by education, training and experience and should 
1029 
demonstrate they have adequate resources and facilities to properly conduct the trial. 
1030 
If organisation of a coordinating committee and/or selection of coordinating 
1031 
investigator(s) are to be utilised in multicentre trials, their organisation and/or 
1032 
selection are the sponsor’s responsibility, and their roles should be documented prior 
1033 
to their involvement in the trial.  
1034 
 
1035 
3.7.2 
The sponsor should provide the investigator(s)/institution(s) with the protocol and an 
1036 
up-to-date Investigator’s Brochure as well as sufficient time for the review of the

25 
 
3.8.2 
Confirmation of Review by IRB/IEC 
1046 
(a) 
Where reference is made to a submission to the IRB/IEC, this can be made by 
1047 
the investigator/institution or sponsor in accordance with applicable regulatory 
1048 
requirements (see section 1.5). 
1049 
 
1050 
(b) 
The sponsor should ensure that the following is obtained:  
1051 
 
1052 
(i) 
The name and address of the relevant IRB/IEC along with:  
1053 
 
1054 
(aa) 
a statement that it is organised and operates according to GCP 
1055 
and the applicable regulatory requirements; 
1056 
 
1057 
(bb) 
documented 
initial 
and 
subsequent 
IRB/IEC 
1058 
approval/favourable opinion as well as any termination of the 
1059 
trial or the suspension of approval/favourable opinion. 
1060 
3.9 
Sponsor Oversight 
1061 
3.9.1 
The sponsor should ensure that the trial design and trial conduct, the processes 
1062 
undertaken, and the information and data generated are of sufficient quality to ensure 
1063 
reliable trial results, trial participant’s safety and appropriate decision making.  
1064 
 
1065 
3.9.2 
The sponsor should ensure that trial processes are conducted in compliance with the 
1066 
trial protocol and related documents as well as with applicable regulatory 
1067 
requirements and ethical standards. 
1068 
 
1069 
3.9.3 
The sponsor should determine necessary trial-specific criteria for classifying protocol 
1070 
deviations as important (i.e., those that impact the rights, safety and well-being of trial 
1071 
participants and the reliability of results). 
1072 
 
1073 
3.9.4 
Decisions related to the trial should be appropriately assessed for their impact on 
1074 
participant’s rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of trial results. Risks 
1075 
related to such decisions should be suitably managed throughout the planning, 
1076 
conduct and reporting of the trial. 
1077 
 
1078 
3.9.5 
The range and extent of oversight measures should be fit for purpose and tailored to 
1079 
the complexity of and risks associated with the trial. The selection and oversight of 
1080 
investigators and service providers are fundamental features of the oversight process. 
1081 
Oversight by the sponsor includes quality assurance and quality control processes 
1082 
relating to the trial-related activities of investigators and service providers.  
1083 
 
1084 
3.9.6 
The sponsor should ensure appropriate and timely escalation and follow-up of issues 
1085 
to allow the implementation of appropriate actions in a timely manner. 
1086 
 
1087 
3.9.7 
The sponsor may consider establishing an IDMC to assess the progress of a clinical 
1088 
trial including the safety data and the efficacy endpoints at intervals and to recommend 
1089 
to the sponsor whether to continue, modify or stop a trial.  
1090

3.9.8 
Where appropriate, sponsors may also establish an endpoint assessment/adjudication 
1091 
committee in certain trials to review important endpoints reported by investigators to 
1092 
determine whether the endpoints meet protocol-specified criteria. Such committees 
1093 
should typically be blinded to the assigned treatments when performing their 
1094 
assessments, regardless of whether the trial itself is conducted in a blinded manner, to 
1095 
ensure that the data reviewed by committee are as free of bias as possible. 
1096 
 
1097 
3.9.9 
Committees established for purposes that could impact participant safety or the 
1098 
reliability of trial results should include members with relevant expertise and with 
1099 
managed conflicts of interest, have written operating procedures (e.g., charters) and 
1100 
document their decisions.  
1101 
3.10 
Quality Management  
1102 
The sponsor should implement an appropriate system to manage quality throughout all stages 
1103 
of the trial process. Quality management includes the design and implementation of efficient 
1104 
clinical trial protocols including tools and procedures for trial conduct (including for data 
1105 
collection and management) in order to support participant’s rights, safety and well-being and 
1106 
the reliability of trial results. The sponsor should adopt a proportionate and risk-based approach 
1107 
to quality management, which involves incorporating quality into the design of the clinical trial 
1108 
(i.e., quality by design) and identifying those factors that are likely to have a meaningful impact 
1109 
on participant’s rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of the results (i.e., critical to 
1110 
quality factors as described in ICH E8(R1)). The sponsor should describe the quality 
1111 
management approach implemented in the trial in the clinical trial report (see ICH E3). 
1112 
3.10.1 
Risk Management 
1113 
A proportionate approach to the identification and management of risk is described below: 
1114 
3.10.1.1 Risk Identification  
1115 
The sponsor should identify risks that may have a meaningful impact on critical to 
1116 
quality factors. Risks should be considered across the processes used in the clinical 
1117 
trial (e.g., patient selection, informed consent process, randomisation and 
1118 
investigational product administration, data handling, and service provider activities).  
1119 
3.10.1.2 Risk Evaluation  
1120 
The sponsor should evaluate potential risks by considering:  
1121 
(a) 
the likelihood of harm/hazard occurring; 
1122 
 
1123 
(b) 
the extent to which such harm/hazard would be detectable; 
1124 
 
1125 
(c) 
the impact of such harm/hazard on trial participant protection and the 
1126 
reliability of trial results. 
1127 
3.10.1.3 Risk Control  
1128 
(a) 
Risk control should be proportionate to the importance of the risk to 
1129 
participants’ rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of trial results. 
1130 


# Page 34

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
27 
 
Risk mitigation activities may be incorporated in protocol design and 
1131 
implementation, monitoring plans, agreements between parties defining roles 
1132 
and responsibilities, systematic safeguards to ensure adherence to SOPs, and 
1133 
training in processes and procedures.  
1134 
 
1135 
(b) 
The sponsor should set acceptable ranges to support this process within which 
1136 
variation can be accepted. Where deviation beyond these ranges is detected, 
1137 
an evaluation should be performed to determine if there is a possible systemic 
1138 
issue and if action is needed.  
1139 
3.10.1.4 Risk Communication  
1140 
The sponsor should communicate the identified risks and mitigating activities, if 
1141 
applicable, to those who are involved in taking action or are affected by such activities. 
1142 
Communication also facilitates risk review and continual improvement during clinical 
1143 
trial conduct.  
1144 
3.10.1.5 Risk Review  
1145 
The sponsor should periodically review risk control measures to ascertain whether the 
1146 
implemented quality management activities remain effective and relevant, taking into 
1147 
account emerging knowledge and experience.  
1148 
3.10.1.6 Risk Reporting 
1149 
The sponsor should summarise and report the risks and the remedial actions taken in 
1150 
relation to important deviations from the acceptable ranges as detailed in section 
1151 
3.10.1.3(b) and document them in the clinical trial report (ICH E3).  
1152 
3.11 
Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
1153 
The sponsor is responsible for establishing, implementing and maintaining 
1154 
appropriate quality assurance and quality control processes and documented 
1155 
procedures to ensure that trials are conducted and data are generated, recorded and 
1156 
reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory 
1157 
requirement(s). 
1158 
3.11.1 
Quality Assurance 
1159 
Quality assurance should be applied throughout the clinical trial and includes 
1160 
implementing strategies to identify potential or actual causes of serious non-
1161 
compliance with the protocol, GCP and/or applicable regulatory requirements to 
1162 
enable their corrective and/or preventive actions. 
1163 
3.11.2 
Audit  
1164 
When performed, audits should be conducted in a manner that is proportionate to the 
1165 
risks associated with the conduct of the trial.  
1166 
The purpose of a sponsor’s audit, which is independent of and separate from routine 
1167 
monitoring or quality control functions, is to evaluate whether the processes put in 
1168 
place to manage and conduct the trial are effective and compliant.  
1169 


# Page 35

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
28 
 
3.11.2.1 Selection and Qualification of Auditors  
1170 
(a) 
The sponsor should appoint individuals who are independent of the clinical 
1171 
trial being audited. 
1172 
  
1173 
(b) 
The sponsor should ensure that the auditors are qualified by training and 
1174 
experience to conduct audits properly.  
1175 
3.11.2.2 Auditing Procedures  
1176 
(a) 
The sponsor should ensure that the auditing of clinical trials/processes is 
1177 
conducted in accordance with the sponsor’s documented procedures on what 
1178 
to audit, how to audit (i.e., on-site or remote), the frequency of audits and the 
1179 
form and content of audit reports.  
1180 
 
1181 
(b) 
The sponsor’s audit plan, program and procedures for a trial audit should be 
1182 
guided by the importance of the trial to submissions to regulatory authorities, 
1183 
the number of participants in the trial, the type and complexity of the trial, the 
1184 
level of risks to the trial participants and any identified problem(s).  
1185 
 
1186 
(c) 
The observations and findings of the auditor(s) should be documented.  
1187 
 
1188 
(d) 
To preserve the independence and value of the audit function, the regulatory 
1189 
authority(ies) should not routinely request the audit reports. Regulatory 
1190 
authority(ies) may seek access to an audit report on a case-by-case basis when 
1191 
evidence of serious GCP non-compliance exists or in the course of legal 
1192 
proceedings.  
1193 
 
1194 
(e) 
When required by applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor should 
1195 
provide an audit certificate.  
1196 
3.11.3 
Quality Control 
1197 
Quality control should be applied to each stage of the data handling to ensure that data 
1198 
are reliable and have been processed correctly. Within clinical trials, monitoring and 
1199 
data management processes are the main quality control activities.  
1200 
 
1201 
The quality control of sites (other than investigator sites, such as centralised imaging 
1202 
reading facilities), including on site and/or centralised activities, may be undertaken 
1203 
and reported using a risk-based approach.  
1204 
3.11.4 
Monitoring  
1205 
The aim of monitoring is to ensure the participants’ rights, safety and well-being and 
1206 
the reliability of trial results as the trial progresses. Monitoring is one of the principal 
1207 
quality control activities. 
1208 
Monitoring involves a broad range of activities including, but not limited to, 
1209 
communication with investigator sites, verification of the investigator and investigator 
1210 
site staff qualifications and site resources, training and review of trial documents and 
1211 


# Page 36

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
29 
 
information using a range of approaches including source data review, source data 
1212 
verification, data analytics and visits to institutional facilities undertaking trial-related 
1213 
activities. Some of these monitoring activities may be conducted by different methods 
1214 
and persons with different roles. However, monitoring should be performed by 
1215 
persons not involved in the clinical conduct of the trial being monitored. The 
1216 
monitoring approach should consider the activities and services involved, including 
1217 
decentralised settings, and be included in the monitoring plan. Monitors and other trial 
1218 
staff should adhere to data protection and confidentiality requirements in accordance 
1219 
with applicable regulatory requirements, institution policy and established data 
1220 
security standards.  
1221 
Monitoring activities may include site monitoring (performed on-site or remotely) and 
1222 
centralised monitoring, depending on the monitoring strategy and the design of the 
1223 
clinical trial. 
1224 
The sponsor should determine the appropriate extent and nature of monitoring, based 
1225 
on identified risks. Factors such as the objective, purpose, design, complexity, 
1226 
blinding, number of trial participants, investigational product, current knowledge of 
1227 
the safety profile and endpoints of the trial should be considered.  
1228 
3.11.4.1 Investigator Site Monitoring  
1229 
(a) 
Monitoring may be performed in relation to the clinical trial activities at the 
1230 
investigator sites (e.g., including their pharmacies and local laboratories, as 
1231 
appropriate). The frequency of monitoring activities should also be determined 
1232 
based on identified risks. Monitoring activities and their frequency should be 
1233 
modified as appropriate using knowledge gained.  
1234 
 
1235 
(b) 
This monitoring activity may be performed on-site or remotely depending on 
1236 
the nature of the activity and its objectives.  
1237 
 
1238 
(c) 
Monitoring may include secure, remote, direct read-only access to source 
1239 
records, other data acquisition tools and essential record retention systems.  
1240 
3.11.4.2 Centralised Monitoring  
1241 
(a) 
Centralised monitoring is an evaluation of accumulated data, performed in a 
1242 
timely manner, by the sponsor’s qualified and trained persons (e.g., medical 
1243 
monitor, data scientist/data manager, biostatistician).  
1244 
 
1245 
(b) 
Centralised monitoring processes provide additional monitoring capabilities 
1246 
that can complement and reduce the extent and/or frequency of site monitoring 
1247 
or be used on its own. Use of centralised data analytics can help identify 
1248 
systemic or site-specific issues, including protocol non-compliance and 
1249 
potentially unreliable data. 
1250 
 
1251 
(c) 
Centralised monitoring may support the selection of sites and/or processes for 
1252 
targeted site monitoring. 
1253 


# Page 37

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
30 
 
3.11.4.3 Monitoring Plan 
1254 
The sponsor should develop a monitoring plan that is tailored to the identified 
1255 
potential safety risks, the risks to data quality and/or other risks to the reliability of 
1256 
the trial results. Particular attention should be given to procedures relevant to 
1257 
participant safety and to trial endpoints. The plan should describe the monitoring 
1258 
strategy, the monitoring activities of all the parties involved, the various monitoring 
1259 
methods and tools to be used, and the rationale for their use. The monitoring strategy 
1260 
should ensure appropriate oversight of trial conduct and consider site capabilities and 
1261 
the potential burden. The plan should focus on aspects that are critical to quality. The 
1262 
monitoring plan should reference the sponsor’s applicable policies and procedures.  
1263 
Monitoring of key data and processes (e.g., those related to primary endpoints and key 
1264 
secondary endpoints and processes intended to assure patient safety) performed 
1265 
outside the investigator site (e.g., central reading facilities, central laboratories) should 
1266 
be addressed in the monitoring plan. 
1267 
3.11.4.4 Monitoring Procedures 
1268 
Persons performing monitoring should follow the sponsor’s monitoring plan and 
1269 
applicable monitoring procedures.  
1270 
3.11.4.5 Monitoring Activities 
1271 
Monitoring in accordance with the sponsor’s requirements and monitoring plan 
1272 
should generally include the following activities across the clinical trial life cycle, as 
1273 
applicable. 
1274 
3.11.4.5.1 
Communication with Parties Conducting the Trial 
1275 
(a) 
Establishing and maintaining a line of communication between the 
1276 
sponsor and the investigator and other parties and individuals involved 
1277 
in the trial conduct (e.g., centrally performed activities). In general, each 
1278 
site should have an assigned monitor as their contact point. 
1279 
 
1280 
(b) 
Informing the investigator or other parties and individuals involved in 
1281 
the trial conduct of identified deviations from the protocol, GCP and the 
1282 
applicable regulatory requirements and taking appropriate action 
1283 
designed to prevent recurrence of the detected deviations. Important 
1284 
deviations should be highlighted and should be the focus of remediation 
1285 
efforts as appropriate.  
1286 
 
1287 
(c) 
Informing the investigator or other parties and individuals involved in 
1288 
the trial conduct of source record(s) or entry errors or omissions in data 
1289 
acquisition tools and ensuring that corrections, additions or deletions are 
1290 
made as appropriate, dated, explained (if necessary) and that approval 
1291 
of the change is properly documented.  
1292 
 
1293 
(d) 
Actions taken in relation to the deviations, errors or omissions should be 
1294 
proportionate to their importance.

1386 
across sites, potential data manipulation and data integrity problems. 
1387 
3.11.4.6 Monitoring Report 
1388 
(a) 
Reports of monitoring activities should include a summary of what was 
1389 
reviewed, a description of significant findings, conclusions and actions 
1390 
required to resolve them and follow-up on their resolution including those not 
1391 
resolved in previous reports. The requirements of monitoring reports 
1392 
(including their content and frequency) should be described in the sponsor’s 
1393 
procedures. 
1394 
 
1395 
(b) 
Reports of investigator site and/or centralised monitoring should be provided 
1396 
to the appropriate sponsor staff as described in the sponsor’s procedures in a 
1397 
timely manner for review and follow-up.  
1398 
 
1399 
(c) 
When needed, the report should describe findings requiring escalation for 
1400 
action and resolution. The sponsor should decide on the appropriate action to 
1401 
be taken, and these decisions and the resolution of the actions involved, where 
1402 
needed, should be recorded. 
1403 
3.12 
Noncompliance  
1404 
3.12.1 
Noncompliance with the protocol, SOPs, GCP and/or applicable regulatory 
1405 
requirement(s) by an investigator/institution or by member(s) of the sponsor’s staff 
1406 
should lead to appropriate and proportionate action by the sponsor to secure 
1407 
compliance. 
1408 
 
1409 
3.12.2 
If noncompliance that significantly affects or has the potential to significantly affect 
1410 
trial participant’s rights, safety or well-being or the reliability of trial results is 
1411 
discovered, the sponsor should perform a root cause analysis, implement appropriate 
1412 
corrective and preventive actions and confirm their adequacy unless otherwise 
1413 
justified. Where the sponsor identifies issues that could significantly impact 
1414 
participant’s rights, safety and well-being or the reliability of trial results, the sponsor 
1415 
should notify the regulatory authority and/or IRB/IEC in line with applicable 
1416 
regulatory requirements. 
1417 
 
1418 
3.12.3 
If the monitoring and/or auditing identifies serious noncompliance on the part of an 
1419 
investigator/institution that persists despite efforts at remediation, the sponsor should 
1420 
terminate the investigator’s/institution’s participation in the trial. When an 
1421 
investigator’s/institution’s participation is terminated because of noncompliance, the 
1422 
sponsor should promptly notify the regulatory authority(ies) and IRB/IEC as 
1423 
appropriate. 
1424 
3.13 
Safety Assessment and Reporting 
1425 
The sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the investigational product(s). 
1426 


# Page 41

34 
 
The Investigator’s Brochure or, where applicable, the current scientific information such as a 
1427 
basic product information brochure, forms the basis of safety assessment and reporting for the 
1428 
clinical trial. For further information, see Appendix A.      
1429 
3.13.1 
Sponsor Review of Safety Information 
1430 
The sponsor should aggregate, as appropriate, and periodically review relevant safety 
1431 
information. This may result in the update of the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, 
1432 
informed consent materials and related documents.  
1433 
The sponsor should review the available emerging safety information to assess 
1434 
whether there is any new data that may affect the participant’s willingness to continue 
1435 
in the trial, impact the conduct of the trial, or alter the approval/favourable opinion of 
1436 
the IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authority(ies), as applicable. Any information of this 
1437 
nature should be communicated to the participants, investigator, IRB/IEC and 
1438 
regulatory authorities, as applicable, in a timely manner. 
1439 
3.13.2 
Safety Reporting   
1440 
(a) 
The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority(ies) safety updates and 
1441 
periodic reports, including changes to the Investigator’s Brochure, as required 
1442 
by applicable regulatory requirements. 
1443 
 
1444 
(b) 
The sponsor should, in accordance with the applicable regulatory 
1445 
requirement(s) and with ICH E2A Clinical Safety Data Management: 
1446 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, expedite the reporting to 
1447 
the regulatory authority(ies) of all adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that meet 
1448 
three criteria: suspected, unexpected and serious (i.e., SUSARs).  
1449 
 
1450 
(c) 
Safety reporting to regulatory authorities should be undertaken by assessing 
1451 
the expectedness of the reaction in relation to the applicable product 
1452 
information (e.g., the reference safety information (RSI) contained within the 
1453 
Investigator’s Brochure or alternative documents) in accordance with 
1454 
applicable regulatory requirements. Refer to ICH E2F Development Safety 
1455 
Update Report for more information about RSI.  
1456 
 
1457 
(d) 
The reporting of SUSARs to investigator(s)/institutions(s) and to the 
1458 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) should be undertaken in a manner that reflects the urgency of 
1459 
action required and should take into consideration the evolving knowledge of 
1460 
the safety profile of the product. Reporting of SUSARs to the 
1461 
investigators/institutions should be made in accordance with regulatory 
1462 
requirements. In some regions, periodic reporting of line listings with an 
1463 
overall safety assessment may be appropriate. 
1464 
 
1465 
(e) 
Urgent safety issues requiring immediate attention or action should be 
1466 
reported to the IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authority(ies) and investigators 
1467 
without undue delay and as specified in regulatory requirements.

(f) 
Alternative arrangements for safety reporting to regulatory authorities, 
1470 
IRBs/IECs, and investigators and for reporting by investigators to the sponsor 
1471 
should be prospectively agreed upon with the regulatory authority(ies) and the 
1472 
IRB/IEC if applicable, and described in the clinical trial protocol, (e.g., SAEs 
1473 
considered efficacy or safety endpoints, which would not be subject to 
1474 
unblinding and expedited reporting; see ICH E2A). See ICH E19. 
1475 
3.13.3 
Managing an Immediate Hazard 
1476 
The sponsor should take prompt action to address immediate hazards to participants. 
1477 
The sponsor should determine the causes of the hazard and based on this, take 
1478 
appropriate remedial actions. 
1479 
The sponsor should consider whether the protocol requires amendment in response to 
1480 
an immediate hazard. The information on the immediate hazard, if required, and any 
1481 
subsequent protocol amendment should be submitted to the IRB/IEC and/or 
1482 
regulatory authorities by the investigator/institution or sponsor (in accordance with 
1483 
applicable regulatory requirements).  
1484 
3.14 
Insurance/Indemnification/Compensation to Participants and Investigators 
1485 
3.14.1 
If required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s), the sponsor should provide 
1486 
insurance or should indemnify (legal and financial coverage) the investigator/the 
1487 
institution against claims arising from the trial except for claims that arise from 
1488 
malpractice and/or negligence. 
1489 
 
1490 
3.14.2 
The sponsor’s policies and procedures should address the costs of treatment of trial 
1491 
participants in the event of trial-related injuries in accordance with the applicable 
1492 
regulatory requirement(s).  
1493 
 
1494 
3.14.3 
The approach to compensating trial participants should comply with applicable 
1495 
regulatory requirement(s).  
1496 
3.15 
Investigational Product(s) 
1497 
3.15.1 
Information on Investigational Product(s)  
1498 
 
1499 
The sponsor should ensure that an Investigator’s Brochure is developed and updated 
1500 
as significant new information on the investigational product becomes available. 
1501 
Alternatively, for authorised medicinal products, the sponsor should identify the basic 
1502 
product information to be used in the trial (see Appendix A). 
1503 
3.15.2 
Manufacturing, Packaging, Labelling and Coding Investigational Product(s)  
1504 
(a) 
The sponsor should ensure that the investigational product(s) (including active 
1505 
control(s) and placebo, if applicable) is characterised as appropriate to the 
1506 
stage of development of the product(s), is manufactured in accordance with 
1507 
any applicable GMP and is coded and labelled in a manner that protects the 
1508 
blinding, if applicable. In addition, the labelling should comply with 
1509 
applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
1510 
 
1511 


# Page 43

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
36 
 
(b) 
The sponsor should determine acceptable storage temperatures and other 
1512 
storage conditions (e.g., protection from light) for the investigational 
1513 
product(s), appropriate reconstitution fluids and procedures, and devices for 
1514 
product infusion, if any. The sponsor should inform all involved parties (e.g., 
1515 
monitors, 
investigators, 
pharmacists, 
storage 
managers) 
of 
these 
1516 
determinations.  
1517 
 
1518 
(c) 
The investigational product(s) should be packaged to prevent contamination 
1519 
and unacceptable deterioration during transport and storage.  
1520 
 
1521 
(d) 
In blinded trials, the sponsor should implement:  
1522 
 
1523 
(i) 
a process to blind the sponsor staff, trial participant and/or investigator 
1524 
as appropriate to the investigational product identity and assignment to 
1525 
prevent and detect inappropriate unblinding; 
1526 
 
1527 
(ii) 
a procedure and mechanism that permits the investigator to rapidly 
1528 
identify the product(s) in case of a medical emergency where 
1529 
unblinding is considered necessary, while protecting the identity of the 
1530 
treatment assignment of the other trial participants; 
1531 
 
1532 
(iii) 
a mechanism that protects the blinding of the trial where a participant’s 
1533 
treatment assignment is unblinded for the purpose of safety reporting 
1534 
to regulatory authorities and/or IRB/IEC, where appropriate. 
1535 
 
1536 
(e) 
If significant formulation changes are made in the investigational product(s) 
1537 
(including active control(s) and placebo, if applicable) during the course of 
1538 
clinical development, the results of any additional studies of the formulated 
1539 
product(s) (e.g., stability, dissolution rate, bioavailability) needed to assess 
1540 
whether these changes would significantly alter the pharmacokinetic profile 
1541 
of the product should be available prior to the use of the new formulation in 
1542 
clinical trials.  
1543 
3.15.3 
Supplying and Handling Investigational Product(s) 
1544 
(a) 
The sponsor is responsible for supplying the investigator(s)/institution(s) with 
1545 
the investigational product(s) or, where appropriate, supplying trial 
1546 
participants in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and after 
1547 
obtaining the required approval/favourable opinion from the IRB/IEC and the 
1548 
regulatory authority(ies) for the trial.  
1549 
 
1550 
(b) 
The sponsor should ensure that instructions are available for the 
1551 
investigator/institution or trial participants on the handling and storage of 
1552 
investigational product(s). The procedures should consider adequate and safe 
1553 
receipt, handling, storage, dispensing, retrieval of unused product from 
1554 
participants and return of unused investigational product(s) to the sponsor (or 
1555

37 
 
alternative disposition if authorised by the sponsor and in compliance with the 
1556 
applicable regulatory requirement(s)).  
1557 
 
1558 
(c) 
The sponsor should:  
1559 
 
1560 
(i) 
ensure timely delivery of investigational product(s) to the 
1561 
investigator(s) or, where appropriate, to trial participants in accordance 
1562 
with applicable regulatory requirements to avoid any interruption to 
1563 
the trial as well as for the continuation of treatment for participants.  
1564 
 
1565 
(ii) 
maintain records that document the identity, shipment, receipt, return 
1566 
and destruction, or alternative disposition of the investigational 
1567 
product(s) (see Appendix C); 
1568 
 
1569 
(iii) 
maintain a system for retrieving investigational products and 
1570 
documenting this retrieval (e.g., for deficient product recall, return and 
1571 
destruction, or alternative disposition after trial completion, or expired 
1572 
product reclaim); 
1573 
 
1574 
(iv) 
maintain a system for the disposition of unused investigational 
1575 
product(s) and for the documentation of this disposition;  
1576 
 
1577 
(v) 
take steps to ensure that the investigational product(s) are stable over 
1578 
the period of use and only used within the current shelf-life; 
1579 
 
1580 
(vi) 
maintain sufficient quantities of the investigational product(s) used in 
1581 
the trials to reconfirm specifications should this become necessary and 
1582 
maintain records of batch sample analyses and characteristics. The 
1583 
samples should be retained either until the analyses of the trial data are 
1584 
complete or as required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s), 
1585 
whichever represents the longer retention period. The samples do not 
1586 
need to be kept by the sponsor in trials where an authorised medicinal 
1587 
product is used as an investigational product unmodified from its 
1588 
authorised state, since samples are kept by the manufacturer.  
1589 
3.16 
Data and Records 
1590 
3.16.1 
Data Handling  
1591 
(a) 
The sponsor should ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data generated 
1592 
and managed. 
1593 
 
1594 
(b) 
The sponsor should apply quality control to the relevant stages of data 
1595 
handling to ensure that the data are of sufficient quality to generate reliable 
1596 
results. The sponsor should focus their quality assurance and quality control 
1597 
activities and data review on critical data, including its relevant metadata.  
1598 
 
1599 


# Page 45

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
38 
 
(c) 
The sponsor should pre-specify data to be collected and the method of its 
1600 
collection in the protocol (see Appendix B. Clinical Trial Protocol and 
1601 
Protocol Amendment(s)). Where necessary, additional details, including a 
1602 
data flow diagram, should be contained in a protocol-related document (e.g., 
1603 
a data management plan).  
1604 
 
1605 
(d) 
The sponsor should ensure that data acquisition tools are fit for purpose and 
1606 
designed to capture the information required by the protocol. They should be 
1607 
validated and ready for use prior to their required use in the trial.  
1608 
 
1609 
(e) 
The sponsor should ensure that documented processes are implemented to 
1610 
ensure the data integrity for the full data life cycle. 
1611 
 
1612 
(f) 
The sponsor should implement measures to ensure the safeguarding of the 
1613 
blinding, if any (e.g., maintain the blinding during data entry and processing).  
1614 
 
1615 
(g) 
The sponsor should provide guidance to investigators/institutions, service 
1616 
providers and trial participants, where relevant, on the expectations for data 
1617 
capture, data changes, data retention and data disposal. 
1618 
 
1619 
(h) 
The sponsor should not make changes to data entered by the investigator or 
1620 
trial participants unless justified and documented by the sponsor and agreed 
1621 
upon by the investigator.  
1622 
 
1623 
(i) 
The sponsor should allow correction of errors to data, including data entered 
1624 
by participants, where requested by the investigators/participants. Such data 
1625 
corrections should be justified and supported by source records around the 
1626 
time of original entry. 
1627 
 
1628 
(j) 
The sponsor should ensure that the investigator has access to data collected in 
1629 
accordance with the protocol during the course of the trial including relevant 
1630 
data from external sources, for example, central laboratory data, centrally read 
1631 
imaging data and, if appropriate, ePRO data that are necessary to enable the 
1632 
investigators to make decisions (e.g., on eligibility, treatment, continuing 
1633 
participation in the trial and care for the safety of the individual trial 
1634 
participants). The sponsor should pay special attention to data that may 
1635 
unblind the investigator and include the appropriate provisions in the protocol.  
1636 
 
1637 
(k) 
The sponsor should not have exclusive control of data captured in data 
1638 
acquisition tools.  
1639 
 
1640 
(l) 
The sponsor should ensure that the investigator has access to the required data 
1641 
for retention purposes.  
1642 
 
1643

(m) 
The sponsor should ensure that the investigator receives instructions on how 
1644 
to navigate systems, data and relevant metadata for the trial participants under 
1645 
their responsibility.  
1646 
 
1647 
(n) 
The sponsor should seek investigator endorsement of their data at 
1648 
predetermined milestones. 
1649 
 
1650 
(o) 
The sponsor should document the data management steps to be undertaken 
1651 
prior to data analysis. These steps may vary depending on the purpose of the 
1652 
analysis to be conducted (e.g., data for IDMC, for interim analysis or the final 
1653 
analysis). 
1654 
 
1655 
(p) 
Prior to provision of the data for analysis, edit access to the data acquisition 
1656 
tools should be restricted as appropriate to the purpose of the analysis; for 
1657 
example, for interim analysis, the restriction may only be temporary or 
1658 
managed differently compared to the final analysis.  
1659 
 
1660 
(q) 
Deviations from the planned statistical analysis or changes made to the data 
1661 
analysis set after the trial has been unblinded (where applicable) should be 
1662 
clearly documented and justified and should only occur in exceptional 
1663 
circumstances (e.g., data discrepancies that must be resolved for the reliability 
1664 
of the trial results). Data changes should be authorised by the investigator and 
1665 
reflected in an audit trail. Post-unblinding data changes and deviations from 
1666 
the planned statistical analyses should be reported in the clinical trial report.  
1667 
 
1668 
(r) 
The sponsor should use an unambiguous trial participant identification code 
1669 
(see glossary term) that allows identification of all the data reported for each 
1670 
participant.  
1671 
 
1672 
(s) 
The sponsor should implement appropriate measures to protect the privacy and 
1673 
confidentiality of personal information of trial participants, in accordance with 
1674 
applicable regulatory requirements on personal data protection.  
1675 
 
1676 
(t) 
In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor should 
1677 
document what happens to data when a participant withdraws or discontinues 
1678 
from the trial.  
1679 
 
1680 
(u) 
The sponsor should ensure that trial data are protected from unauthorised 
1681 
access, disclosure, dissemination or alteration and from inappropriate 
1682 
destruction or accidental loss. 
1683 
 
1684 
(v) 
The sponsor should have processes and procedures in place for reporting 
1685 
incidents (including security breaches) that have a significant impact on the 
1686 
trial data to relevant parties, including regulatory authorities, where relevant.  
1687

(w) 
When using computerised systems in a clinical trial, the sponsor should: 
1690 
 
1691 
(i) 
have a record of the computerised systems used in a clinical trial. This 
1692 
should include the use, functionality, interfaces and validation status 
1693 
of each computerised system, and who is responsible for its 
1694 
management should be described. The record should also include a 
1695 
description of implemented access controls and internal and external 
1696 
security measures; 
1697 
 
1698 
(ii) 
ensure that the requirements for computerised systems deployed by the 
1699 
sponsor (e.g., requirements for validation, audit trails, user 
1700 
management, backup, disaster recovery and IT security) are addressed 
1701 
and implemented and that documented procedures and adequate 
1702 
training are in place to ensure the correct development, maintenance 
1703 
and use of computerised systems in clinical trials (see section 4). These 
1704 
requirements should be proportionate to the importance of the 
1705 
computerised system and the data or activities they are expected to 
1706 
process; 
1707 
 
1708 
(iii) 
maintain a record of the individual users who are authorised to access 
1709 
the system, their roles and their access privileges: 
1710 
 
1711 
(iv) 
ensure that access rights granted to investigator site staff are in 
1712 
accordance with delegations by the investigator and visible to the 
1713 
investigator;  
1714 
 
1715 
(v) 
for systems deployed by the investigator/institution, assess whether 
1716 
such systems, if identified as containing source records in the trial, 
1717 
(e.g., electronic health records and other record keeping systems for 
1718 
source data collection and investigator site files) are fit for purpose or 
1719 
whether the known issue(s) can be appropriately mitigated. This 
1720 
assessment should occur during the process of selecting clinical trial 
1721 
sites and should be documented; 
1722 
 
1723 
(vi) 
ensure that there is a process in place for service providers and 
1724 
investigators to inform the sponsor of system defects identified or 
1725 
incidents that could potentially constitute a serious non-compliance 
1726 
with the clinical trial protocol, trial procedures or GCP in accordance 
1727 
with section 3.13.

(c) 
The sponsor should ensure that the allocation to or exclusion of each trial 
1742 
participant from any analysis set is predefined (e.g., in the protocol or the 
1743 
statistical analysis plan). The rationale for inclusion or exclusion for any 
1744 
participant (or particular data point) should be clearly described and 
1745 
documented.  
1746 
 
1747 
(d) 
Procedures should be in place to describe unblinding; these descriptions 
1748 
should include: 
1749 
 
1750 
(i) 
who was unblinded, at what timepoint and for what purpose they were 
1751 
unblinded; 
1752 
 
1753 
(ii) 
who should remain blinded; 
1754 
 
1755 
(iii) 
the safeguards in place to preserve the blinding. 
1756 
 
1757 
(e) 
The sponsor should retain the statistical programming records that relate to the 
1758 
output contained or used in reports of the trial results, including quality 
1759 
control/validation activities performed. Outputs should be traceable to the 
1760 
statistical software programs, and they should be dated and time stamped and 
1761 
protected against any changes. 
1762 
3.16.3 
Record Keeping and Retention  
1763 
(a) 
The sponsor (or subsequent owners of the data) should retain all of the 
1764 
sponsor-specific essential records pertaining to the trial in conformance with 
1765 
the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
1766 
 
1767 
(b) 
The sponsor should inform the investigator(s)/institution(s) and service 
1768 
providers, when appropriate, in writing of the need for essential records 
1769 
retention and should notify the investigator(s)/institution(s) and service 
1770 
providers, when appropriate, in writing when the trial-related records are no 
1771 
longer needed.  
1772

1774 
requirement(s).  
1775 
3.16.4 
Record Access  
1776 
(a) 
The sponsor should ensure that it is specified in the protocol or other 
1777 
documented agreement that the investigator(s)/institution(s) provide direct 
1778 
access to source records for trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review 
1779 
and regulatory inspection.  
1780 
 
1781 
(b) 
The sponsor should ensure that trial participants have consented to direct 
1782 
access to their original medical records and other participant-related trial 
1783 
documents for trial-related monitoring, audit, IRB/IEC review and regulatory 
1784 
inspection as part of the informed consent.  
1785 
3.17 
Reports 
1786 
3.17.1 
Premature Termination or Suspension of a Trial  
1787 
If a trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor should promptly inform 
1788 
the investigators/institutions and the regulatory authority(ies) of the termination or 
1789 
suspension and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The IRB/IEC should 
1790 
also be informed promptly and provided with the reason(s) for the termination or 
1791 
suspension by the sponsor or by the investigator/institution, in accordance with 
1792 
applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
1793 
3.17.2 
Clinical Trial/Study Reports 
1794 
(a) 
Whether the trial is completed or prematurely terminated or an interim analysis 
1795 
is undertaken for regulatory submission, the sponsor should ensure that the 
1796 
clinical trial reports, including interim reports, are prepared and provided to 
1797 
the regulatory agency(ies) as required by the applicable regulatory 
1798 
requirement(s). The sponsor should also ensure that the clinical trial reports in 
1799 
marketing applications meet the standards of ICH E3 or are otherwise in 
1800 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. (Note: ICH E3 specifies 
1801 
that abbreviated study reports may be acceptable in certain cases.) 
1802 
 
1803 
(b) 
Investigators should be provided with a summary of the trial results.  
1804 
 
1805 
(c) 
Consideration should be given to providing the investigator with information 
1806 
about the final treatment taken by their participants for blinded trials and a 
1807 
brief summary of the overall outcome of the trial. Where this information is 
1808 
provided to participants, the language should be non-technical, understandable 
1809 
to a layperson and non-promotional. The sponsor should only supply this 
1810 
information after the trial has been unblinded and all relevant 
1811 
analyses/conclusions have been completed and finalised.

DATA GOVERNANCE – INVESTIGATOR AND SPONSOR  
1813 
This section provides guidance to investigators and sponsors (i.e., the responsible parties) on 
1814 
appropriate management of data integrity, traceability and security, thereby allowing the 
1815 
accurate reporting, verification and interpretation of the clinical trial-related information. This 
1816 
section should be read in conjunction with corresponding responsibilities for the investigator 
1817 
and the sponsor as defined in sections 2 and 3, along with ICH E8(R1) and ICH E9. 
1818 
The quality and amount of the information generated in a clinical trial should be sufficient to 
1819 
address trial objectives, provide confidence in the trial’s results and support good decision 
1820 
making. 
1821 
The systems and processes that help ensure this quality should be designed and implemented 
1822 
in a way that is proportionate to the risks to participants and the reliability of trial results.  
1823 
The following key processes should address the full data life cycle with a focus on the criticality 
1824 
of the data and should be implemented proportionately and documented appropriately:  
1825 
(a) 
processes to ensure data protection of trial participants’ confidential data; 
1826 
 
1827 
(b) 
processes for managing computerised systems to ensure that they are fit for 
1828 
purpose and used appropriately; 
1829 
 
1830 
(c) 
processes to safeguard essential elements of the clinical trial, such as 
1831 
randomisation, dose escalation and blinding; 
1832 
 
1833 
(d) 
processes to support key decision making, such as data finalisation prior to 
1834 
analysis, unblinding, allocation to analysis data sets, changes in clinical trial 
1835 
design and, where applicable, the activities of, for example, an IDMC. 
1836 
4.1 
Safeguard Blinding in Data Governance 
1837 
4.1.1 
Maintaining the integrity of the blinding is important in particular in the design of 
1838 
systems, management of users’ account, delegation of responsibilities with respect to 
1839 
data handling and provision of data access at sites, data transfers, database review 
1840 
prior to planned unblinding and statistical analysis across all appropriate stages of the 
1841 
trial.  
1842 
 
1843 
4.1.2 
Roles, responsibilities and procedures for access to unblinded information should be 
1844 
defined and documented by all relevant parties according to the protocol; this 
1845 
information may also be included in the data management plans and statistical 
1846 
analysis plans. For example, in blinded trials, sponsor staff or designated third parties 
1847 
who are involved in operation of the trial and directly or indirectly interact with site 
1848 
investigator staff should not have access to unblinding information.  
1849 
 
1850 
4.1.3 
The potential for unblinding should be part of the risk assessment of a blinded trial. 
1851 
Any planned or unplanned unblinding, including accidental or emergency unblinding, 
1852 
should be documented and assessed for impact to trial results.  
1853

4.2 
Data Life Cycle Elements 
1854 
Procedures should be in place to cover the full data life cycle.  
1855 
4.2.1 
Data Capture  
1856 
(a) 
The requirements for and extent of data verification, when data captured on 
1857 
paper or in an electronic health record are manually transcribed into a 
1858 
computerised system, should take the criticality of the data into account. Refer 
1859 
to section 4.2.3 for data entered directly in data acquisition tools. 
1860 
(b) 
Acquired data from any source should be accompanied by relevant metadata. 
1861 
At the point of data capture, automated data validation checks should be 
1862 
considered as required based upon risk, and their implementation should be 
1863 
controlled and documented. 
1864 
 
1865 
4.2.2 
Relevant Metadata, Including Audit Trails 
1866 
The approach used by the responsible party for implementing, evaluating, accessing, 
1867 
managing and reviewing relevant metadata associated with critical data should entail:  
1868 
 
1869 
(a) 
Evaluating the system for the types and content of metadata available to ensure 
1870 
that:  
1871 
(i) 
computerised systems maintain logs of user account creation, changes 
1872 
to user roles and permissions and user access; 
1873 
 
1874 
(ii) 
systems are designed to permit data changes in such a way that the 
1875 
initial data entry and any subsequent changes or deletions are 
1876 
documented, including, where appropriate, using a risk-based 
1877 
evaluation, the reason for the change if it is not implicit; 
1878 
 
1879 
(iii) 
systems record and maintain workflow actions in addition to direct 
1880 
data entry/changes into the system. 
1881 
(b) 
Ensuring that audit trails, reports and logs are not disabled or modified except 
1882 
in rare circumstances and only if a log of such action and justification is 
1883 
maintained; 
1884 
 
1885 
(c) 
Ensuring that audit trails and logs are decipherable and can facilitate analysis; 
1886 
 
1887 
(d) 
Ensuring that the automatic capture of date and time of data entries or transfer 
1888 
using data acquisition tools are unambiguous (e.g., coordinated universal time 
1889 
(UTC)); 
1890 
 
1891 
(e) 
Determining which of the identified metadata require review and retention. 
1892 


# Page 52

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
45 
 
4.2.3 
Review of Data and Metadata  
1893 
Procedures for review of trial-specific data, audit trails and other relevant metadata 
1894 
should be in place. It should be a planned activity, and the extent and nature should 
1895 
be adapted to the individual trial and adjusted based on experience during the trial.  
1896 
4.2.4 
Data Corrections  
1897 
There should be processes to correct data errors that could impact the reliability of the 
1898 
trial results. Corrections should be attributed to the entity making the correction, 
1899 
justified and supported by source records around the time of original entry, and 
1900 
performed in a timely manner. 
1901 
4.2.5 
Data Transfer, Exchange and Migration  
1902 
Validated processes or other appropriate processes such as reconciliation should be in 
1903 
place to ensure that electronic data transferred between computerised systems retains 
1904 
its integrity and preserves its confidentiality. The transfer process should be 
1905 
documented to ensure traceability, and data reconciliation should be implemented as 
1906 
appropriate. 
1907 
4.2.6 
Finalisation of Data Sets Prior to Analysis 
1908 
(a) 
Data of sufficient quality for interim and final analysis are achieved by 
1909 
implementing timely and reliable processes for data capture, verification, 
1910 
validation, review and rectification of errors and omissions that have a 
1911 
meaningful impact on the safety of trial participants and/or the reliability of 
1912 
the trial results.  
1913 
 
1914 
(b) 
Activities undertaken to finalise the data sets prior to analysis should be 
1915 
confirmed and documented in accordance with pre-specified procedures. 
1916 
These activities may include reconciliation of entered data and data sets or 
1917 
reconciliation of relevant databases, correction of data errors and omissions, 
1918 
medical coding, compilation and addressing the impact of non-compliance 
1919 
including protocol deviations.  
1920 
 
1921 
(c) 
Data extraction and determination of data analysis sets should take place in 
1922 
accordance with the planned statistical analysis and should be documented. 
1923 
4.3 
Computerised Systems 
1924 
As described in sections 2 and 3, the responsibilities of the sponsor, investigator and 
1925 
the activities of other parties with respect to a computerised system used in clinical 
1926 
trials should be clear and documented. In summary, the sponsor is responsible for 
1927 
ensuring that for computerised systems which they put in place, the expectations for 
1928 
computerised systems as described in this section are addressed in a risk proportionate 
1929 
manner. The sponsor should review whether the systems used by the 
1930 
investigator/institution (e.g., electronic health records and other record keeping 
1931 
systems for source data collection) are fit for purpose in the context of the trial. In the 
1932 
event that the investigator/institution deploys systems specifically for the purposes of 
1933 


# Page 53

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
46 
 
conducting clinical trials, the investigator/institution should ensure that the 
1934 
expectations are proportionately addressed and implemented. 
1935 
The responsible party should ensure that those developing computerised systems for 
1936 
clinical trials are aware of the intended purpose and the regulatory requirements that 
1937 
apply to them. 
1938 
It is recommended that representatives of intended participant populations and 
1939 
healthcare professionals are involved in the design of the system, where relevant, to 
1940 
ensure that computerised systems are suitable for use by the intended user population.  
1941 
4.3.1 
Procedures for the Use of Computerised Systems  
1942 
Documented procedures should be in place to ensure the appropriate use of 
1943 
computerised systems in clinical trials for essential activities related to data collection, 
1944 
handling and management.  
1945 
4.3.2 
Training 
1946 
The responsible party should ensure that those using computerised systems are 
1947 
appropriately trained in their use.  
1948 
4.4 
Security of Computerised Systems 
1949 
4.4.1 
The security of the trial data and records should be managed throughout the data life 
1950 
cycle.  
1951 
 
1952 
4.4.2 
The responsible party should ensure that security controls are maintained for 
1953 
computerised systems. These controls should include user management and ongoing 
1954 
measures to prevent, detect and/or mitigate security breaches. Aspects such as user 
1955 
authentication requirements and password management, firewall settings, antivirus 
1956 
software, security patching, system monitoring and penetration testing should be 
1957 
considered. 
1958 
 
1959 
4.4.3 
The responsible party should maintain adequate backup of the data.  
1960 
 
1961 
4.4.4 
Procedures should cover the following: system security measures, data backup and 
1962 
disaster recovery. 
1963 
4.5 
Validation of Computerised Systems 
1964 
4.5.1 
The responsible party is responsible for the validation status of the system throughout 
1965 
its life cycle. The approach to validation of computerised systems should be based on 
1966 
a risk assessment that considers the intended use of the system; the purpose and 
1967 
importance of the data/record that is collected/generated, maintained and retained in 
1968 
the system; and the potential of the system to affect the well-being, rights and safety 
1969 
of trial participants and the reliability of trial results.  
1970 
 
1971 
4.5.2 
Validation should demonstrate that the system conforms to the established 
1972 
requirements for completeness, accuracy, and reliability and is consistent with 
1973 
intended performance.  
1974 


# Page 54

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
47 
 
4.5.3 
Systems should be appropriately validated prior to use with adequate change control 
1975 
procedures implemented.  
1976 
 
1977 
4.5.4 
Validation of changes should be based on risk and consider both previously collected 
1978 
and new data. 
1979 
 
1980 
4.5.5 
Both basic system functionality and protocol specific configurations and 
1981 
customisations, including automated data entry checks and calculations, should be 
1982 
validated. Interfaces between systems should also be defined and validated. Different 
1983 
degrees of qualification/validation may be needed for bespoke systems, systems 
1984 
designed to be configured or systems where no alterations are needed. 
1985 
 
1986 
4.5.6 
Where relevant, procedures should cover the following: system design, validation, 
1987 
and functionality testing; release; setup; installation and change control until 
1988 
decommissioning. 
1989 
 
1990 
4.5.7 
The responsible party should ensure that the computerised systems used in clinical 
1991 
trial processes are qualified and validated, including those developed by other parties. 
1992 
They should ensure that qualification and validation documentation is maintained and 
1993 
retained.  
1994 
 
1995 
4.5.8 
Validation should generally include defining the requirements and specifications for 
1996 
the system and their testing, along with the associated documentation, to ensure the 
1997 
system is fit for purpose, especially for critical functionality, such as randomisation, 
1998 
dosing and dose titrations and reductions, and collection of endpoint data. 
1999 
 
2000 
4.5.9 
Unresolved issues, if any, should be justified and, where relevant, addressed by 
2001 
mitigations prior to and/or during the continued use of the system. 
2002 
 
2003 
4.5.10 
The trial-specific systems (including updates resulting from protocol amendments) 
2004 
should only be implemented to enable the conduct of the trial by the investigator after 
2005 
all necessary approvals for the clinical trial have been received. 
2006 
4.6 
System Failure 
2007 
Contingency procedures should be in place to prevent loss or lack of accessibility to data 
2008 
essential to participant safety, trial decisions or trial outcomes. 
2009 
4.7 
Technical Support 
2010 
4.7.1 
Where appropriate, there should be mechanisms (e.g., help desk support) in place to 
2011 
document, evaluate and manage issues with the computerised systems (e.g., raised by 
2012 
users), and there should be periodic review of these cumulative issues to identify those 
2013 
that are repeated and/or systemic.  
2014 
 
2015 
4.7.2 
Defects and issues should be resolved according to their criticality. Issues with high 
2016 
criticality should be resolved in a timely manner. 
2017

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
48 
 
4.8 
User Management 
2018 
4.8.1 
Access controls are integral to computerised systems used in clinical trials to limit 
2019 
system access to authorised users and to ensure attributability to an individual. The 
2020 
security measures should be selected in such a way that they achieve the intended 
2021 
security and do not unduly impact user-friendliness. 
2022 
4.8.2 
Procedures should be in place to ensure that user access rights are appropriately 
2023 
assigned based on a user’s duties and functions, blinding arrangements and the 
2024 
organisation to which users belong. Access rights should be revoked when they are 
2025 
no longer needed.  
2026 
4.8.3 
Authorised users and access privileges should be clearly documented, maintained and 
2027 
retained. These records should include any updates to a user’s roles, access rights and 
2028 
permissions, and time of access privileges given (e.g., time stamp).

GLOSSARY 
2030 
Adverse Events and Adverse Reaction-related definitions:  
2031 
Adverse Event (AE): Any unfavourable medical occurrence in a trial participant. The 
2032 
adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. 
2033 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR):  
2034 
• in the pre-approval clinical experience with a new investigational product or its new 
2035 
usages (particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established): 
2036 
unfavourable and unintended responses, such as a sign (e.g., laboratory results), 
2037 
symptoms or disease related to any dose of a medicinal product where a causal 
2038 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is a reasonable 
2039 
possibility. The level of certainty about the relatedness of the adverse drug reaction 
2040 
to an investigational product will vary. If the ADR is suspected to be medicinal 
2041 
product-related with a high level of certainty, it should be included in the reference 
2042 
safety information (RSI) and/or the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
2043 
 
2044 
• for marketed medicinal products: a response to a drug that is noxious and 
2045 
unintended and that occurs at doses normally used in humans for prophylaxis, 
2046 
diagnosis or therapy of diseases or for modification of physiological function.  
2047 
(See ICH E2A Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for 
2048 
Expedited Reporting). 
2049 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any unfavourable medical occurrence that is considered 
2050 
serious at any dose if it: 
2051 
• results in death 
2052 
• is life-threatening 
2053 
• requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 
2054 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
2055 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (see ICH E2A) 
2056 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR): an adverse reaction that 
2057 
meets three criteria: suspected, unexpected and serious.  
2058 
• Suspected: There is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse drug 
2059 
reaction. 
2060 
 
2061 
• Unexpected: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent 
2062 
with the applicable product information (e.g., the RSI, see glossary term contained 
2063 
within the Investigator’s Brochure or alternative documents according to applicable 
2064 
regulatory requirements. Refer to ICH E2F Development Safety Update Report for

2153 
clinical trial and may be performed in person or remotely. Any party (e.g., domestic and foreign 
2154 
regulatory authorities, sponsor’s monitors and auditors) with direct access should take 
2155 
reasonable precautions within the constraints of the applicable regulatory requirement(s) to 
2156 
maintain the confidentiality of participants’ identities and their data and sponsor’s proprietary 
2157 
information. 
2158 
Essential Records  
2159 
Essential records are the documents and data (and relevant metadata), in any format, associated 
2160 
with a clinical trial that facilitate the ongoing management of the trial and collectively allow 
2161 
the evaluation of the methods used, the factors affecting a trial and the actions taken during the 
2162 
trial conduct to determine the reliability of the trial results produced and the verification that 
2163 
the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP and applicable regulatory requirements (see 
2164 
Appendix C. Essential Records for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial). 
2165 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
2166 
A standard for the planning, initiating, performing, recording, oversight, evaluation, analysis 
2167 
and reporting of clinical trials that provides assurance that the data and reported results are 
2168 
reliable and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected. 
2169 
Impartial Witness 
2170 
A person who is independent of the trial who cannot be unfairly influenced by people involved 
2171 
with the trial, who attends the informed consent process if the participant or the participant’s 
2172 
legally acceptable representative cannot read, and who reads the informed consent form and 
2173 
any other documented information supplied or read to the participant and/or their legally 
2174 
acceptable representative. 
2175 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
2176 
An independent data monitoring committee (e.g., data safety monitoring board) that may be 
2177 
established by the sponsor to assess at intervals the progress of a clinical trial, the safety data 
2178 
and the critical efficacy endpoints, and to recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, 
2179 
modify or stop a trial.

opportunity to discuss all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the participant’s decision to 
2185 
participate. Varied approaches to the provision of information and the discussion about the trial 
2186 
can be used. This can include, for example, providing text in different formats, images and 
2187 
videos and using telephone or video conferencing with investigator site staff. Informed consent

other things, reviewing and approving/providing favourable opinion on the trial protocol, the 
2205 
suitability of the investigator(s), the facilities, and the methods and material to be used in 
2206 
obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial participants. The legal status, 
2207 
composition, function, operations and regulatory requirements pertaining to IRBs/IECs may 
2208

APPENDICES 
2337 
Appendix A. INVESTIGATOR’S BROCHURE  
2338 
A.1 
Introduction  
2339 
The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) is a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical data on the 
2340 
investigational product(s)1 that are relevant to the study of the product(s) in human participants. 
2341 
Its purpose is to provide the investigators and others involved in the trial with the information 
2342 
to facilitate their understanding of the rationale for and their compliance with many key 
2343 
features of the protocol, such as the dose, dose frequency/interval, methods of administration 
2344 
and safety monitoring procedures. 
2345 
 
2346 
A.1.1 
Development of the Investigator’s Brochure 
2347 
Generally, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that an up-to-date IB is developed. 
2348 
In the case of an investigator-initiated trial, the sponsor-investigator should determine 
2349 
whether a brochure is available from the product license/marketing authorisation 
2350 
holder. If the investigational product is provided by the sponsor-investigator, then they 
2351 
should provide the necessary information to the investigator site staff. Where 
2352 
permitted by regulatory authorities, the current scientific information such as a basic 
2353 
product information brochure (e.g., summary of product characteristics package 
2354 
leaflet, or labelling) may be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes 
2355 
current, comprehensive and detailed information on all aspects of the investigational 
2356 
product that might be of importance to the investigator. If an authorised medicinal 
2357 
product is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB specific to that 
2358 
new use should be prepared unless there is a rationale for only one IB. The IB should 
2359 
be reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary in compliance with a sponsor’s 
2360 
documented procedures. More frequent revision may be appropriate depending on the 
2361 
stage of development and the generation of relevant new information. Relevant new 
2362 
information may be so important that it needs to be communicated to the investigators 
2363 
and possibly to the IRBs/IECs and/or regulatory authorities before it is included in a 
2364 
revised IB.  
2365 
 
2366 
A.1.2 
Reference Safety Information and Risk-Benefit Assessment 
2367 
The reference safety information (RSI) contained in the IB provides an important 
2368 
reference point for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse 
2369 
reactions (SUSARs) in the clinical trial. The IB also provides insight to support the 
2370 
clinical management of the participants during the course of the clinical trial. The 
2371 
information should be presented in a concise, simple, objective, balanced and non-
2372 
promotional form that enables a clinician or potential investigator to understand it and 
2373 
make their own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the 
2374 
proposed trial. For this reason, a medically qualified person should be involved in the 
2375 
generation of an IB, but the contents of the IB should be approved by the disciplines 
2376 
that generated the described data. 
2377 
 
 
1 For the purpose of this guideline, the term “investigational products” should be considered synonymous with 
drugs, medicines, medicinal products, vaccines and biological products.

A.2 
General Considerations  
2378 
These considerations delineate the minimum information that should be included in an IB. It is 
2379 
expected that the type and extent of information available will vary with the stage of 
2380 
development of the investigational product.  
2381 
The IB should include;  
2382 
A.2.1 
Title Page  
2383 
This should provide the sponsor’s name, the identity of each investigational product 
2384 
(i.e., research number, chemical or approved generic name and trade name(s) where 
2385 
legally permissible and desired by the sponsor) and the release date. It is also 
2386 
suggested that an edition number and a reference to the number and date of the edition 
2387 
it supersedes be provided along with the cut-off date for data inclusion in the version. 
2388 
Where appropriate, a signature page may be included.  
2389 
A.2.2 
Confidentiality Statement  
2390 
The sponsor may wish to include a statement instructing the investigator and other 
2391 
recipients to treat the IB as a confidential document for the sole information and use 
2392 
of the investigator/institution, investigator site staff, regulatory authorities and the 
2393 
institutional review board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC).  
2394 
A.3 
Contents of the Investigator’s Brochure  
2395 
The IB should contain the following sections, each with literature references (publications or 
2396 
reports) included at the end of each chapter, where appropriate;  
2397

2407 
expected position within this class (e.g., advantages); the rationale for performing 
2408 
research with the investigational product(s); and the anticipated prophylactic, 
2409 
therapeutic or diagnostic indication(s). Finally, the introductory statement should 
2410 
provide the general approach to be followed in evaluating the investigational product.  
2411 
A.3.4 
Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation  
2412 
A description should be provided of the investigational product substance(s) 
2413 
(including the chemical and/or structural formula(e)), and a brief summary should be 
2414 
given of the relevant physical, chemical and pharmaceutical properties.

2492 
relative) using a reference dosage form 
2493 
•

2497 
 
2498 
(b) 
Safety and Efficacy  
2499 
A summary of information should be provided about the investigational 
2500 
product’s/products’ 
(including 
metabolites, 
where 
appropriate) 
safety, 
2501 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy and dose response that was obtained from preceding 
2502 
trials in humans (healthy volunteers and/or patients). The implications of this 
2503 
information should be discussed. In cases where a number of clinical trials have been 
2504 
completed, the use of summaries of safety and efficacy across multiple trials by 
2505 
indications in subgroups may provide a clear presentation of the data. Tabular 
2506 
summaries of adverse drug reactions for all the clinical trials (including those for all 
2507 
the studied indications) would be useful. Important differences in adverse drug 
2508 
reaction patterns/incidences across indications or subgroups should be discussed.  
2509 
The IB should provide a description of the possible risks and adverse drug reactions 
2510 
to be anticipated on the basis of prior experiences with the product under investigation 
2511 
and with related products. There should be a list of adverse reactions, clearly identified 
2512 
as the reference safety information section, including information on their frequency 
2513 
and nature. This list should be used for determining the expectedness of a suspected 
2514 
serious adverse reaction and subsequently whether it needs to be expedited in 
2515 
accordance with regulatory requirements. A description should also be provided of 
2516 
the precautions or special monitoring to be done as part of the investigational use of 
2517 
the product(s).  
2518 
(c) 
Marketing Experience  
2519 
The IB should identify countries where the investigational product has been marketed 
2520 
or approved. Any significant information arising from the marketed use should be 
2521 
summarised (e.g., formulations, dosages, routes of administration, adverse drug 
2522 
reactions). The IB should also identify all the countries where the investigational 
2523 
product did not receive approval/registration for marketing or was withdrawn from 
2524 
marketing/registration. 
2525 
A.3.7 
Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator  
2526 
This section should provide an overall discussion of the nonclinical and clinical data 
2527 
and should summarise the information from various sources on different aspects of 
2528 
the investigational product(s), wherever possible. In this way, the investigator can be 
2529 
provided with the most informative interpretation of the available data and with an 
2530 
assessment of the implications of the information for future clinical trials.  
2531 
Where appropriate, the published reports on related products should be discussed. 
2532 
This could help the investigator to anticipate adverse drug reactions or other problems 
2533 
in clinical trials.  
2534 
The overall aim of this section is to provide the investigator with a clear understanding of the 
2535 
possible risks and adverse reactions and of the specific tests, observations and precautions that 
2536 
may be needed for a clinical trial. This understanding should be based on the available physical, 
2537 


# Page 70

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
63 
 
chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological and clinical information on the 
2538 
investigational product(s). Guidance should also be provided to the clinical investigator on the 
2539 
recognition and treatment of possible overdose and adverse drug reactions that is based on 
2540 
previous human experience and on the pharmacology of the investigational product.  
2541

Appendix B. CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL AND PROTOCOL AMENDMENT(S)  
2542 
Clinical trials should be described in a clear, concise and operationally feasible protocol. The 
2543 
protocol should be designed in such a way as to minimise unnecessary complexity and to 
2544 
mitigate or eliminate important risks to the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial participants 
2545 
and the reliability of data. Protocol development processes should incorporate input from 
2546 
relevant stakeholders, where appropriate. Building adaptability into the protocol, for example, 
2547 
by including acceptable ranges for specific protocol provisions, can reduce the number of 
2548 
deviations or in some instances the requirement for a protocol amendment. Such adaptability 
2549 
should not adversely affect participant safety or the scientific validity of the trial. For additional 
2550 
information, refer to ICH E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies and ICH E9 
2551 
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials.  
2552 
The contents of a trial protocol should generally include the following topics, which may vary 
2553

Appendix C. ESSENTIAL RECORDS FOR THE CONDUCT OF A CLINICAL TRIAL 
2684 
C.1 
Introduction 
2685 
C.1.1 
Many records are generated before and during the conduct of a clinical trial. The 
2686 
nature and extent of those records generated and maintained are dependent upon the 
2687 
trial design, its conduct, application of proportional approaches and the importance 
2688 
and relevance of that record to the trial.  
2689 
 
2690 
C.1.2 
Determining which records are essential will be based upon consideration of the 
2691 
guidance in this appendix.  
2692 
 
2693 
C.1.3 
The essential records permit and contribute to the evaluation of the conduct of a trial 
2694 
and the reliability of the results produced. They serve to demonstrate the compliance 
2695 
of the investigator and sponsor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
2696 
and applicable regulatory requirements. The essential records are used as part of the 
2697 
sponsor oversight or investigator supervision of the trial. These records are used by 
2698 
the sponsor’s independent audit function and during inspections by regulatory 
2699 
authority(ies) to assess the trial conduct and the reliability of the trial results. The 
2700 
investigator/institution should have access to and the ability to maintain and retain the 
2701 
essential records generated by the investigator/institution before, during and after the 
2702 
trial. 
2703 
C.2 
Management of Essential Records 
2704 
C.2.1 
Records should be identifiable and version controlled, and should include authors, 
2705 
reviewers and approvers as appropriate, along with date and signature (electronic or 
2706 
wet ink), where necessary. 
2707 
 
2708 
C.2.2 
For activities that are transferred or delegated to service providers by the sponsor or 
2709 
investigator/institution respectively, arrangements should be made for the access and 
2710 
management of the essential records throughout the trial and for their retention 
2711 
following completion of the trial. 
2712 
 
2713 
C.2.3 
These essential records should be maintained in or referred to from repositories, 
2714 
including, for example, the trial master file (TMF) or investigator site file (ISF). The 
2715 
TMF is held by the sponsor or by the investigator; in the latter case, it is often called 
2716 
the ISF.  
2717 
 
2718 
C.2.4 
The sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of where essential 
2719 
records are located, including source records. The storage system(s) used during the 
2720 
trial and for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for 
2721 
appropriate identification, version history, search and retrieval of trial records. 
2722 
 
2723 
C.2.5 
The sponsor and investigator/institution should ensure that the essential records are 
2724 
collected and filed in a timely manner, including those required to be in place prior to 
2725 
the trial start, which can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial. 
2726 


# Page 76

ICH E6(R3) Guideline 
 
69 
 
C.2.6 
The sponsor and investigator/institution should retain the essential records in a way 
2727 
that ensures that they remain complete, readable and readily available and are directly 
2728 
accessible upon request by regulatory authorities. Alteration to the essential records 
2729 
should be traceable. 
2730 
 
2731 
C.2.7 
The original version of the essential record should be retained by the responsible party 
2732 
(sponsor or investigator). When a copy is used to permanently replace the original 
2733 
essential record, the copy should fulfil the requirements for certified copies. 
2734 
 
2735 
C.2.8 
In order to fulfil their responsibilities in the conduct of the trial, the sponsor and 
2736 
investigator/institution may need access to or copies of one another’s relevant 
2737 
essential records before, during and after the trial is completed. This will determine 
2738 
whether 
the 
record 
resides 
in 
the 
repositories 
of 
the 
sponsor, 
the 
2739 
investigator/institution, or both. There should be careful consideration of sharing of 
2740 
records subject to data protection legislation and blinding considerations in line with 
2741 
applicable regulatory requirements. For the sharing of essential records with service 
2742 
providers, see section C.2.2.  
2743 
 
2744 
C.2.9 
Certain essential records may not be specific to a trial but may be related to the 
2745 
systems and processes involved in running multiple trials and retained outside the 
2746 
trial-specific repositories (e.g., standard operating procedures validation records, 
2747 
master services agreements). 
2748 
C.3 
Essentiality of Trial Records  
2749 
C.3.1 
Whether a specific clinical trial record generated before, during and after the trial is 
2750 
essential and needs to be retained should be based on the following criteria: 
2751

2752 
IRB/IEC, including related correspondence and those documenting regulatory 
2753 
decisions or approvals/favourable opinions;  
2754 
(b) 
Is a trial-specific procedure or plan;  
2755 
(c)

C.3.2 
Applying the criteria in section C.3.1, the trial records for every trial that are 
2821 
considered essential, except in justifiable and documented exceptional circumstances, 
2822 
are set out in Table 1, and these should be retained. 
2823 
 
2824 
C.3.3 
For other trial records, their presence and nature are dependent upon the trial design, 
2825 
its conduct and risk proportional management. Table 2 lists potential trial records that 
2826 
when generated, would be considered essential by applying the criteria in section 
2827 
C.3.1 and should be retained. This is not an exhaustive list, and other trial records may 
2828 
also be considered essential by the sponsor or the investigator.
