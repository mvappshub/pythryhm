ICH E6(R3) Guideline: Focus on IT Computerized Systems for SOP Development

The ICH E6(R3) guideline provides a unified standard for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in the conduct of clinical trials involving human participants. It emphasizes protecting participants' rights, safety, and well-being while ensuring the reliability of clinical trial data. The guideline applies to interventional clinical trials intended for submission to regulatory authorities.
Focus on IT Computerized Systems for SOP Development:
This section focuses on areas within ICH E6(R3) relevant to developing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for IT computerized systems used in clinical trials. The SOP should address data integrity, traceability, security, and privacy throughout the data life cycle.
Key Areas for SOP Development:
1. Data Integrity:
Data Capture:
Define procedures for data capture from various sources, including manual transcription from paper or electronic health records and direct entry into data acquisition tools.
Specify the required metadata accompanying acquired data.
Implement automated data validation checks at the point of capture, based on risk assessment.
Relevant Metadata and Audit Trails:
Ensure the system captures and maintains relevant metadata, including audit trails, to reconstruct the course of events.
Define procedures for reviewing and retaining identified metadata.
Data Corrections:
Establish processes for correcting data errors that could impact the reliability of trial results.
Ensure corrections are attributed, justified, supported by source records, and performed timely.
Data Transfer, Exchange, and Migration:
Implement validated processes to ensure data integrity and confidentiality during transfer between systems.
Document the transfer process and implement data reconciliation as appropriate.
Finalization of Data Sets Prior to Analysis:
Define procedures for data finalization, including reconciliation, error correction, coding, and addressing non-compliance.
Ensure data extraction and analysis set determination follow the planned statistical analysis and are documented.
2. Computerized Systems:
Procedures for Use:
Develop documented procedures for the appropriate use of computerized systems in essential trial activities.
Training:
Ensure all personnel using computerized systems are adequately trained and training is documented.
Security:
Implement security controls for computerized systems, including user management, authentication, firewalls, antivirus software, security patching, system monitoring, and penetration testing.
Maintain adequate data backups and disaster recovery procedures.
Validation:
Validate systems based on a risk assessment considering intended use, data importance, and potential impact on participant safety and data reliability.
Validate systems before use and implement change control procedures.
Validate both basic functionality and protocol-specific configurations.
Document and retain validation documentation.
3. System Failure:
Establish contingency procedures to prevent data loss or inaccessibility that could impact participant safety, trial decisions, or outcomes.
4. Technical Support:
Implement mechanisms to document, evaluate, and manage issues with computerized systems.
Review cumulative issues to identify recurring or systemic problems.
Resolve issues based on their criticality, prioritizing those with high impact.
5. User Management:
Implement access controls to limit system access to authorized users and ensure individual attributability.
Define procedures for assigning and revoking user access rights based on roles, blinding arrangements, and organizational affiliation.
Document, maintain, and retain records of authorized users and access privileges.
Additional Considerations for SOP Development:
Data Privacy:
Implement measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants' personal information in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.
Use unambiguous participant identification codes to protect participant identity.
Blinding:
Develop procedures to safeguard blinding during data handling and access, including user account management, data transfer, and database review.
Define roles, responsibilities, and procedures for accessing unblinded information.
Assess the potential for unblinding as part of the risk assessment for blinded trials.
Document and assess the impact of any planned or unplanned unblinding.
Compliance with Regulatory Requirements:
Ensure the SOP aligns with applicable regulatory requirements and GCP guidelines.
